Effect of nanoclay content and compatibilizer on viscoelastic properties of montmorillonite/polypropylene nanocompositesHighlights
                  ► Synthesis of nanocomposites were carried out using master batch route. ► Properties of nanocomposites were obtained with and without compatabilizers. ► Better viscoelastic properties resulted with nanoclay addition. ► Use of compatibilizer resulted in degradation of properties of nanocomposites. ► AFM confirmed the experimental results.['The use of thermoplastics have been continuously increasing in the last few years and penetrated the various fields, such as automotive and aerospace industry, household and sport appliances which are once dominated by conventional materials like metals and alloys.
 The increasing demand for thermoplastics underlines the need of elevated reliability, lightweight, higher strength, higher stiffness and better viscoelastic properties.
 These requirements can be satisfied by exploring new materials with reinforcing these polymeric materials with nanoparticles such as nanoclay.
', 'Generally, virgin polymers are filled or reinforced with various fillers like clay, synthetic fibers, bio-fibers, etc.
 in order to improve the mechanical and thermal properties of the polymers.
 However, a higher weight of filler loading (up to 50%) is usually required in order to impart the desired properties.
 It has been shown that organically modified layered silicates (organoclay) can achieve the same properties with typically 2–5% by weight of filler, thereby producing materials of lower density and better processing ability [b0005]. Reinforcing the matrix material with one or more separate nano-materials results in improved mechanical and thermal properties of the composites also referred as nanocomposites [b0010 b0015 b0020 b0025 b0030].', 'Polymer-layered silicate nanocomposites are currently prepared in four ways – in situ polymerization [b0035], intercalation from a polymer solution [b0040], direct intercalation by molten polymer [b0045] and sol–gel technology [b0050]. Melt intercalation method involves annealing, statically or under shear, a mixture of the polymer and organically modified layered silicates above the softening point of the polymer.
 According to Ray and Okamoto [b0055] direct intercalation by molten polymer method of preparation of nanocomposites has greater advantages over other methods as this method is environmentally benign due to the absence of organic solvents and is compatible with current industrial process, such as extrusion and injection molding.
 In the current work, preparation of nanocomposites is done through direct intercalation by using equipments such as torque rheometer, twin-screw extruder and injection molding machine.
 In this study, nanoclay modified with quaternary ammonium salt is used.
 The commonly used organo-modification agents are long carbon-chain alkyl ammonium salts.
 The quaternary ammonium ion is nominally chosen to compatibilize the layered silicate with a given polymer resin.
 However, the molecular structure, such as alkyl chain length and number of alkyl chains is the determining factor of the thermal stability of the polymer/MMT nanocomposites [b0060].', 'Compatibility of matrix and reinforcing material is known to play a very important role in determining the mechanical properties of the composites.
 Sharma and Nayak [b0065] studied three different compositions of unmodified and modified nanoclay with varying percentages of nanoclay (3, 5 and 7wt.
%) and without compatibilizer on PP-nanocomposites.
 After optimization of the mechanical properties, different percentages (5, 10, 15 and 20wt.
%) of compatibilizer (PP-g-MA) were used in the preparation of nanocomposites and mechanical properties were investigated again.
 They claimed that only 20wt.
% compatibilizer gave better results.
 Bahrami and Mirzaie [b0070] studied the effect of nanoclay and compatibilizer on mechanical properties of PP-nanocomposites and showed that addition of PP-g-MA decrease tensile strength and tensile modulus but addition of nanoclay increased tensile modulus because of its reinforcement effect.
 Deenadayalan et al. [b0005] investigated nanocomposites of polypropylene impact copolymer and organoclays to know the impact of different compatibilizers viz.
 polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PPMA), polyethylene-graft-maleic anhydride (PEMA) and their mixture by varying percentages of clay (3% and 6%) in an attempt to obtain balanced mechanical properties.
 Nanocomposites with both PPMA and PEMA showed increase in tensile modulus, but only a marginal increase in tensile strength and in some cases, it actually decreased.
 They stated that the mixed compatibilizer system seems to provide the best balance of mechanical properties among all nanocomposite compositions investigated.
 Nevertheless, they did not compare the results without any compatibilizers.
 Karmarkar et al. [b0075] have reported isocyanate based m-TMI-g-PP as an effective coupling agent in wood polymer composites resulting in superior strength and stiffness of the composites as compared to the composites prepared using MAPP, the conventional coupling agent.
 They argued that –NCO group present in m-TMI-g-PP can covalently link with hydroxyl groups present on wood substrate.
 The effectiveness of this coupling agent on nanoclay filled polyropylene composites has not been studied.
 Since nanoclay also possess hydroxyl functionality, it is anticipated that m-TMI-g-PP will improve the interfacial adhesion between nanoclay and polypropylene.
 In the present study, dynamic mechanical properties of polypropylene – nano clay composites prepared with and without compatibilizer (m-TMI-g-PP) are studied over a wide range of temperature and frequencies.
 Results obtained are validated by morphological studies using atomic force microscopy.

', ['Storage modulus', ['[f0005]shows the change in storage modulus (<i>E′</i>) as a function of temperature at 5Hz frequency for PP, PPNX-UC and PPNX_C.
 Virgin PP has shown storage modulus of 3750MPa at −40°C whereas composites without compatibilizer at 9% nanoclay has exhibited storage modulus of 5120MPa.
 Composites with compatibilizer also exhibited superior storage modulus as compared to virgin PP with maximum storage modulus at 9% nanoclay content.
 Even at 80°C storage modulus of composite without and with compatibilizer was 57% and 39% higher respectively than the storage modulus of virgin PP.
 The results are in line with the reported in literature [b0065 b0095 b0130]. The extent in increase is found to be related to the type of nanoclay, clay content, compatibilizer and processing parameters.
 Misra et al. [b0135] reported about 50% increase in storage modulus in PP-nanoclay composite at 4% nanoclay and at 25°C.
 Sharma and Nayak [b0065] reported only 10–17% increase in storage modulus at 3% nanoclay content measured at −150°C.
 Comparison of storage modulus of PP and PP nanocomposites with and without compatibilizer at different temperatures and at 55Hz is given in [t0005]   . The difference in storage modulus between the two composites was maximum (∼18%) at 3% nanoclay content at −40°C.
 At higher nanoclay content, the difference was narrowed down to about 6–7.5%. The results observed here are in contrast to the reported effect of compatibilizer on storage modulus of PP-nanoclay composites.
 In most of the studies, maleic anhydride grafted PP (PP-g-MA) has been used as the compatibilizer and was found to enhance the mechanical properties of the composites [b0130 b0140 b0145 b0150]. However, the effect of compatibilizer depends on the type of compatibilizer and clay characteristics.
 Sharma and Nayak [b0065] observed contrasting effect of PP-g-MA as the compatibilizer on storage modulus in PP-nanoclay composites prepared using <i>p</i>-aminobenzoic acid modified nanoclay and octadecylamine modified nanoclay respectively.
 Use of polyolefin elastomer grafted maleic anhydride (POE-g-MA) as compatibilizer has been reported to reduce storage modulus in polypropylene/clay nanocomposites contrary to PP-g-MA compatibilizer [b0130].', 'These differences in storage modulus in composite with and without compatibilizer could be attributed to the differences in dispersion of nanoclay in the composite.
 Hambir et al. [b0155] reported that the enhancement in storage modulus in nanocomposite is closely linked with the nano scale dispersion of clay in the matrix.
 Loss modulus ([f0010]   ) peaked near the glass transition temperature and thereafter it decreased sharply indicating the increased flow of chain movements above transition temperature.
 Yang et al. [b0160] have reported the increase in loss modulus with the inclusion of nano-fillers.
 It is also evident from [f0010] that the addition of nanoclay did not affect the peak loss modulus temperature as the peak is around 4°C which is mainly concerned with the molecular motion of crystalline region of PP.
', 'To analyze the effect of compatibilizer, loss modulus of PP and nanocomposites with and without compatibilizer at different temperatures and at 55Hz is given in [t0010]   . No specific trend was evident for the effect of compatibilizer on loss modulus.
 Loss modulus of composites with compatibilizer was higher than without compatibilizer for 3% and 9% nanoclay content.
 However, at 6% nanoclay, the effect was opposite.
']], ['Damping coefficient', ['Damping coefficient as a function of temperature for PP and PP nanocomposites (PPNX-UC, PPNX_C) at a frequency of 5Hz is shown in [f0015]and comparison of damping coefficients of PP and PP nanocomposites with and without compatibilizer at different temperatures and at 55Hz is given in [t0015]   . The value of peak of tan   <i>δ</i> is commonly taken to be the glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>   g) of the material. Glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>   g) for PP is found to be 10.5°C.
 From the graph ([f0015]), it is observed that the glass transition temperature of PPN3-UC and PPN6-UC is same as that of PP, but glass transition temperature increased to 14.5°C for PPN9-UC at 5Hz.
 However, there was no increase in the value of <i>T</i>   g for the coupled nanocomposites ([t0015]). The shift in glass transition temperature towards higher temperature at higher concentration of nanoclay indicates greater thermal stability at higher filler loading.
 Composites prepared at higher nanoclay (9%) without compatibilizer also exhibited significantly low damping coefficient as compared to pure PP below glass transition.
 At lower nano content, (3% and 6%) there was no significant difference in damping coefficient of composites (PPN3-UC and PPN6-UC) with pure PP.
 Lee et al. [b0150] also find no significant influence of nanoclay content on tan   <i>δ</i> in polyethylene-layered silicate nanocomposites with or without PP-g-MA compatibilizer.
 General increase in storage modulus and loss modulus and decrease in damping coefficient with increasing micro-filler like wood fibers in natural fiber filled composites has been reported by many researchers [b0165 b0170].']], ['Effect of frequency', ['Dynamic mechanical properties such as storage modulus and damping coefficient depend on both temperature and frequency.
', '[f0020]shows the variation of storage modulus versus frequency at −40°C, 10°C, 50°C and 100°C for PPN3-C and PPN3-UC.
 It is found that <i>E′</i> for PPN3-UC is higher than that of PPN3-C for all frequencies (5Hz–100Hz). However, variation of <i>E′</i> with frequency is marginal for both PPN3-C and PPN3-UC within the studied frequency range.
', '[f0025 f0030]   show the plot of tan   <i>δ</i> versus temperature at 5Hz,55Hz and 85Hz for PP and PPN9-UC respectively.
 Glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>   g) for PP is found to be 10.5°C at 5Hz.
 As the frequency is increased, <i>T</i>   g also increased to 15.4 for PP and uncoupled nanocomposites at the frequencies of 55Hz and 85Hz.
 It is clear from the [f0020 f0030] that loading of nanoclay, temperature and frequency have the effect on glass transition temperature.
 <i>T</i>   g for PPN9-UC is found to be 20°C at a frequency of 85Hz.
 10mm×10mm×3mm injection molded nanocomposite specimens were used for analysis.
 Topographical study was carried out on 9% nanoclay loading specimens with and without compatibilizer.
 [f0035 f0045] show the phase contrast and height contrast images of PPN9-UC and there is a uniform distribution of nanoclay in the polypropylene matrix.
 Similarly, [f0040 f0050] show the phase contrast and height contrast images of PPN9-C respectively.
 It is also evident from [t0005] that relative increase in storage modulus in composites with compatibilizer with the increase in nanoclay from 6% to 9% nanoclay was relatively small at sub-ambient temperature and rather decreased at higher temperatures (>40°C). This phenomenon could also be attributed to the increased clustering of nanoclay at higher clay content in composites with compatibilizer.
 Dayma and Sathpathy [b0175] have reported the increased clustering at 4% nanoclay than at 2% nanoclay content in polyamide-polythene-nanoclay composites.
