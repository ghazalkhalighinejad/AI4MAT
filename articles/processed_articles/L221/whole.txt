Comparative studies for the effect of intercalating agent on the physical properties of epoxy resin-clay based nanocomposite materialsIn this study, a series of comparative studies for the effect of intercalating agent on the physical properties of the epoxy resin-clay based nanocomposite materials were performed. First, the quaternary alkylphosphonium and alkylammonium salt were both used as the intercalating agents separately for the preparation of organophilic clay through the cationic exchange reactions with Na+-montmorillonite clay. Subsequently, the organophilic clay was blent into the epoxy resin through <i>in-situ</i> thermal ring-opening polymerizations to prepare a series of polymer-clay nanocomposite (PCN) materials. The as-synthesized PCN materials were subsequently characterized by Fourier-Transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, wide-angle powder X-ray diffraction (WXRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
                  It should be noted that the quaternary alkylphosphonium salt (Φ3P+-C12)-modified clay was found to show better dispersion capability than that of quaternary alkylammonium salt (Me3N+-C16)-modified clay existed in the polymer matrix based on the studies of WXRD and TEM. The better dispersion of (Φ3P+-C12)-modified clay in epoxy resin was found to lead more effectively enhanced physical property such as corrosion protection, gas barrier, mechanical strength, thermal stability, and flame retardant properties of polymers than that of (Me3N+-C16)-modified clay, in the form of coating and membrane, based on the measurements of a series of electrochemical corrosion parameters, gas permeability analysis (GPA), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and limiting oxygen index (LOI), respectively. Effect of material composition on the physical properties of as-prepared materials was also investigated.['Nanocomposite materials consisted of organic polymeric matrix and inorganic nano-layered clay platelets have lately evoked a great deal of academic and industrial research activities due to their uniqueness of combining the organic and inorganic characteristics at the molecular level, leading to the formation of nanocomposite materials with effectively enhanced physical properties such as thermal properties (e.

', 'Currently, Na+-montmorillonite (Na+-MMT) clay is widely used in the preparation of polymer nanocomposite materials because its lamellar elements exhibit high in-plane strength, stiffness, and high aspect ratio.
 Typically, the chemical structures of MMT consist of two fused silica tetrahedral sheets sandwiching an edge-shared octahedral sheet of either magnesium or aluminum hydroxide.
 The Na+ and Ca2+ residing in the interlayer regions usually can be replaced by organic cations such as alkylammonium ions by a cationic-exchange reaction to render the hydrophilic-layered silicate organophilic.
 The organophilically charged clay layers exchanged by cationic surfactants playing an important role for the intercalation.
', 'In the past decades, thermosetting polymers such as epoxy resin, polyimide or phenolic resins attracted many chemists, physicists, and material scientists devoting efforts to study their nanocomposites.
 Among these thermosets, epoxy resins evoked intensive studies much in the preparation of nanocomposite materials lately due to their high tensile strength, and modulus, good adhesive properties, good chemical, and corrosion resistance, low shrinkage in cure, and excellent dimensional stability.
 Up to date, many published literatures in terms of the investigations focused on the investigations of epoxy resin-clay nanocomposite materials have been reported and concentrated mainly on the exploration of mechanical and thermal properties based on the comparative studies between nanocomposites containing raw Na+-MMT and organophilic clay [bib11]. However, effect of different intercalation agent on physical properties of nanocomposite materials has seldom been mentioned.
', 'Therefore, in this study, we present a series of comparative studies for the effect of intercalating agent on physical properties of epoxy resin-clay based nanocomposite materials.
 The as-synthesized nanopcomposite materials were subsequently characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, WXRD, and TEM.
', 'Effect of intercalation agent used on the physical properties of nanocomposite materials (e.
g.
, corrosion protection, gas barrier, mechanical strength, thermal stability, and flame retardant properties) in the form of coating and membrane, was evaluated a series of based on the measurements of electrochemical corrosion parameters, GPA, DMA, DSC, TGA, and LOI, respectively.
 Furthermore, effect of material composition on the physical properties was also investigated.

['In this work, one tri-functional epoxy as well as one tri-functional amine monomers for the formation of epoxy resin matrix and two different types of intercalation agents for the modification of Na+-MMT clay was used and their chemical structures were shown in [fig1] . The two cationic surfactants were used for performing a series of comparative studies for the effect of intercalation agent on the physical properties of as-prepared materials.
', ['Characterization', ['The representative FTIR spectra of the organophilic clay, epoxy resin, and a series of PCN materials with various clay loadings were shown in [fig2]. The spectroscopy confirmed the completeness of the curing process (i.
, oxide-ring-opening polymerizations) between the epoxy ring of TGTPM and primary amine group of hardener T-403, as indicated by the diminishness and enhancement of characteristic peaks appeared at 915cm−1 (i.
, epoxy ring) and 3380cm−1 (i.
, -OH), as shown in [fig2](a). Moreover, the epoxy monomer was further reacting with the secondary hydroxyl groups of the high-molecular weight epoxy resin to form an ether linking at 1233cm−1 (C–O–C) [bib17 bib18]. The vibration bands of dodecyltriphenyl-phosphonium (Φ3P+-C12) MMT clay, and hexadecyltirmethyl-ammonium (Me3N+-C16) MMT clay were shown at 3600cm−1 (free H2O), 2926cm−1, 2852cm−1 (CH2), 1478cm−1 (Me–N), 1455cm−1 (Acyl–P), 1040cm−1 (Si–O), 510cm−1 (Al–O), and 460cm−1 (Mg–O). When the loading of organophilic MMT clay was increased, the intensities of those peaks become stronger, as illustrated in the FTIR spectra of PCN materials ([fig2](b)).']], ['Morphological characteristics', ['The wide-angle powder XRD was used to determine the d-spacing of organophilic clays in epoxy resin matrix.
 As showed in [fig3](a) illustrated that the organophilic clay modified with Me3N+-C16 and Φ3P+-C12 had a <i>d</i>001 spacing of 22.53Å (2<i>θ</i>=3.92°) and 31.34Å (2<i>θ</i>=2.82°), respectively, and both were higher than the pristine Na+-MMT clay with a <i>d</i>001 spacing of 12.69Å (2<i>θ</i>=6.96°), which was calculated on the basis of Bragg’s equation (<i>nλ</i>=2<i>d</i>sin<i>θ</i>, <i>λ</i>=1.5418Å, Cu Kα1). It indicated that the both cationic surfactants had been intercalated into the intragallery region of the clay layers through the cationic exchange reactions.
 It should be noted that the quaternary phosphonium salt-modified clay showed a larger <i>d</i>001-spacing than that of quaternary ammonium salt-modified clay.
 After incorporation of organophilic clay into epoxy resin, we also found that the system containing quaternary phosphonium salt exhibited a better dispersion capability in polymer matrix, as shown in [fig3](b). For example, TECN7 revealed an obvious peak at 2<i>θ</i>=2.68° (<i>d</i>-spacing=32.97Å). However, for TECP7, there is a lack of any diffraction peak in 2<i>θ</i>=2–10° as opposed to the diffraction peak at 2<i>θ</i>=2.82° (<i>d</i>-spacing=31.34Å) for organophilic clay, indicating the possibility of having exfoliated silicate nanolayers of organophilic clay dispersed in an epoxy resin matrix.
 As shown in [fig4], the TEM micrographs of TECP7 ([fig4](b)) exhibited a better dispersion capability of organophilic clay platelets as compared to that of TECN7 ([fig4](a)), which is consistent with the previous conclusions obtained from the powder XRD studies.
']], ['Anticorrosion properties of coatings', ['In this study, protective performance against corrosion of sample-coated CRS coupons in saline conditions was determined from a series of electrochemical parameter measurements such as corrosion potential (<i>E</i>corr), polarization resistance (<i>R</i>p), corrosion current (<i>I</i>corr), and corrosion rate (<i>R</i>corr), as listed in [tbl1]. The <i>E</i>corr, <i>R</i>p, <i>I</i>corr, and <i>R</i>corr for epoxy coating on CRS show better corrosion resistance compared to the uncoated CRS.
 Furthermore, the CRS coupon coated with PCN materials all show significantly higher values of <i>E</i>corr, and <i>R</i>p, and lower values of <i>I</i>corr, and <i>R</i>corr than the neat epoxy coating, as showed in [tbl1]. In addition, the TECP system exhibited higher corrosion potential than TECN system, for example, TECP7 exhibiting <i>E</i>corr=−268.8mV was superior to <i>E</i>corr=−309.9mV of TECN7. Such an <i>E</i>corr value implied that the TECP-coated CRS coupon was more inert toward the electrochemical corrosion relative to the TECN-coated specimen [bib10]. Moreover, TECP1 presented the polarization resistance (<i>R</i>p) of 129.52kΩcm2 in 5wt% NaCl, which was 3-fold of magnitude greater than the TECN1. The Tafel plots for (a) bare (naked cold-rolled steel, CRS), (b) pure epoxy resin, (c) TECN1, (d) TECP1, (e) TECN7, and (f) TECP7 were shown in [fig5]. On the other hand, the corresponding corrosion current (<i>I</i>corr) of TECP1 was <i>ca</i>. 0.1776μA/cm2, which corresponds to a corrosion rate (<i>R</i>corr) of ca.
 8.29×10−2 MPY, as shown in [tbl1]. Electrochemical parameters such as <i>I</i>corr and <i>R</i>corr values of TECP1 coated on CRS were found to decrease 93% as compared to 55% of TECN1.', 'Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also used to examine the activity on the CRS surface treated by PCN coatings.
 [fig6] showed the Nyquist plots of the six measured samples (a) bare (naked cold-rolled steel, CRS), (b) pure epoxy resin, (c) TECN1, (d) TECP1, (e) TECN7, and (f) TECP7 in order.
 The corrosion of these samples in 5wt% NaCl aqueous electrolyte for 30min was followed by EIS.
 The charge-transfer resistances of those samples as determined by the intersection of the high-frequency end from the low-frequency end of the semicircle arc with the real axis were 1.03, 10.6, 90.9, 148, 490, and 600kΩcm2, respectively [bib19]. The results clearly demonstrated that the PCN matrix with Φ3P+-C12-modified clay had the greatest anticorrosive performance.
 frequency) of samples (a–f) were shown in [fig7]. In conclusion, the PCN coatings containing quaternary phosphonium salt-modified clay exhibited better corrosion protection performance on CRS coupons than that with quaternary ammonium salt-modified clay based on the electrochemical corrosion parameter measurements such as Tafel plot, Bode plot, Nyquist plot, etc.
 This can be further identified by the studied of O2 and H2O molecular barrier effect as discussed in the next section.
, a nematic phase) to make long detours round the platelets and changes in the local permeability [bib20]. The membranes used for the molecular permeability measurements were prepared to have a thickness of ca.
 ∼0.175mm.
 For the oxygen and water vapor permeability studies, meanwhile, we found that the incorporation of different organophilic clay into epoxy resin matrix results in a distinct reduction of barrier properties for epoxy resin-clay nanocomposite membranes, as listed in [fig8]. Compared to that pure epoxy resin, free-standing films of TECP and TECN system at clay loading (e.
, 7wt%) showed 86.1% and 66% reduction of oxygen permeability, respectively.
 Nevertheless, it should be further noted that an immense decrease in the amount of TECP7 was 92.58g/m2-h extremely for the water vapor permeability studies, as illustrated in [tbl1]. For these, one factor should be considered, namely a geometric factor about the rigid phenyl group and long-chain alkyl group pendant in dodecyltriphenyl-phosphonium salt, could significantly result in an exfoliated clay structure [bib21].']], ['Thermal and dynamic mechanical properties', ['The glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>g) based on the DSC evaluations was found to increase form 83.63°C of neat polymer up to 120.46°C of TECP7, as shown in [fig9] and [tbl2]. The effectively enhanced <i>T</i>g of TECP7 may probably associated with the good dispersion of quaternary phosphonium salt-modified clay in polymer framework, which led to a large interfacial contact area between the inorganic clay platelets and organic epoxy resin matrix.
 Furthermore, the highly dense network of epoxy resin was also favored the interactions between the clay nano-layers by its homopolymerization within the clay galleries, and then polymer chains may be tied through the surface of the silicate by electrostatic interaction, thus increasing the surrounding entanglements [bib22 bib23].', 'Subsequently, the thermo-mechanical properties of composite materials were also investigated through the performing of DMA tests using a tension mode.
 The curves in [fig10] illustrated the dependence of the storage modulus and the tan<i>δ</i>, respectively.
 The data also summarized the storage modulus values for the PCN materials at 35°C (glassy region, below <i>T</i>g) and at 130°C (rubbery region, above <i>T</i>g), along with the <i>T</i>g values obtained from the maximum in tan<i>δ</i>, as shown in [tbl2]. The storage moduli of as-prepared materials in the glassy region, the superior dispersion of Φ3P+-C12-modified clay in epoxy resin matrix led to an effective enhancement of mechanical strength.
 For example, the storage modulus was increased from the neat epoxy resin matrix of 2311MPa up to TECP7 of 3597MPa.
 Furthermore, the incorporation of organophilic clay in polymer matrix also exhibit significant improvements of mechanical strength of neat polymer matrix in the rubbery region shown in [tbl2] for the evaluation of tan<i>δ</i>. For example, the <i>T</i>g of the TECP7 was found to be higher than TECN7, which is probably due to the Brownian motion of network chains [bib18], and the results were consistent with our previous DSC studies.
 In general, there appeared to be three stages of weight loss starting at ∼150°C and ending at 800°C, which might be correspondent to the degradation of intercalation agents (i.
, 150–250°C) followed by the structural decomposition of uncrosslinked (i.
, 250–450°C) and crosslinked (i.
, 500–650°C) component of epoxy resin, as shown in [fig11] [bib24 bib25 bib26].', 'The flammability properties of the PCN materials were examined by measuring their corresponding LOI value.
 For example, the LOI value of TECN7 and TECP7 was equal to 24.5 and 27.5, respectively, which was obviously higher than that of neat epoxy resin (i.
, LOI=19). The higher LOI value of TECP7 as compared to that of TECN7, as shown in [tbl2], may be probably due to the better organophilic clay dispersion of TECP7 in epoxy resin.
