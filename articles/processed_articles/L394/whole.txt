Preparation and thermal properties of polystyrene/silica nanocompositesA series of polystyrene/silica nanocomposites with different inorganic nanofiller content were prepared by evaporating of toluene solvent. The weight fraction of silica nanoparticles of an average diameter of 7nm treated with hexamethyldisilazane was varied (2, 5, 10, 15 and 30wt.%). The polystyrene nanocomposite morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The thermal stability of the samples was determined using thermogravimetry, coupled with differential scanning calorimetry. The influence of the filler content on glass transition temperature of polystyrene/silica nanocomposites was followed by differential scanning calorimetry. It was found that the polystyrene glass transition temperature was influenced by the hydrophobic silica content. A mathematical method to describe the glass transition temperature dependence on the polystyrene/silica ratio is proposed. According to the experimental results and calculations, the highest thermal stability of the nanocomposite belongs to 18% silica content.['Polymer nanocomposites are a novel class of composites derived from the ultrafine inorganic particles with large surface area per volume unit and dimensions with a typical range of 1–1000nm, dispersed in the polymer matrix [bib0005 bib0010]. Organic/inorganic composite materials combine the advantages of the inorganic materials such as rigidity, hardness, durability, thermal stability and those of the organic polymers (flexibility and processability). Due to the unique properties, these types of materials have attracted strong interest in many industrial processes [bib0015]. The potential applications of polymer nanocomposites are coatings, flame retardant materials, optical devices, electronical and optical packaging materials, etc.
 [bib0020 bib0025 bib0030]. A lot of works deals with various types of nanosized fillers and various methods of polymer/nanocomposites technology [bib0035 bib0040 bib0045 bib0050 bib0055]. Among the numerous organic/inorganic nanocomposites the preparation, characterization, properties and applications of polystyrene/silica systems have been reported as a great area of active research [bib0005 bib0060]. The dispersion of nanometer-sized particles in the polymer matrix has a significant impact on the properties of nanocomposites.
 A variety of methods have been used to enhance the compatibility between the hydrophobic polystyrene and silica.
 The most frequently used method is to modify the surface of silica nanoparticles either by chemical or physical methods.
 The extremely large surface area and smooth nonporous surface of silica nanoparticles can intensify the effect of particle–particle and/or polymer–particle interactions, which could promote strong physical contact between the silica and the polystyrene [bib0065 bib0070]. The loading of inorganic particles within polymers is usually performed by a wide range of methods, but unfortunately the simple mixing of organic and inorganic components at the macroscopic level is energy consuming and usually not very successful [bib0005]. Thermal stability is considered as an important factor from the scientific and industrial point of view, playing role in the nanocomposite structure and morphology formation [bib0075]. A better understanding of polymer degradation gives valuable data on the period of the applicability time of the material [bib0080]. It has been shown that the thermal behavior of polymer nanocomposites depends on the nanofiller type and content [bib0085 bib0090]. One of the properties of a polymer, which can be profoundly affected by nanoparticles, is the glass transition temperature <i>T</i> g.
 It has been reported that polymers <i>T</i> g can be changed by the addition of nanofiller [bib0095 bib0100]. The temperature range of the availability of hybrid materials depends, among others, on their glass transition temperature.
 Therefore, it is of a great importance to develop a method to predict the <i>T</i> g of a new material [bib0105 bib0110]. In this paper a simple method for nanocomposite preparation in solution [bib0115] was applied to prepare a series of polystyrene/silica nanocomposite materials.
 In order to improve nanocomposite homogeneity, silica with chemically modified surface was dispersed by ultrasonic treatment.
 The aim of the work was to study the influence of different silica content on thermal properties of polystyrene hybrid materials prepared in the form of film.
 The correlation between glass transition temperature of polystyrene nanocomposites and filler content was described by fitted hyperbolic equation.
 The additional goal was to determine the optimum silica content for the enhancement of the nanocomposites thermal stability.

 The other characteristic absorption bands are (cm−1): ν(C–H)ar, 3082w, 3060w and 3025w, ν(C–H), 2925w, 2849w, ν(C–C) 1492w, 1452w, δ(C–H)ar 754m, γring 695s (the abbreviations s, m and w mean strong, medium and weak, respectively; the sing ar refers to the C–H vibration of the aromatic ring).']], ['SEM investigation of polystyrene/silica nanocomposites', ['[fig0005 fig0010] show the SEM images of polystyrene filled with 15 and 30wt.
', 'In [fig0005 fig0010], where the scale bar corresponds to 1μm, a good dispersion of silica nanoparticles in polystyrene matrix can be observed, but also agglomerates with varying size of the dispersed phase are noticed.
 In the polystyrene with 15wt.
% of nanofiller, the average particle size is of the order of 60nm, but particles of about 30nm are also detected with few agglomerates of a greater size.
 For silica content of 30wt.
% the material exhibits a significant number of agglomerates with an average particle size of about 120nm, which might lead to deterioration of nanocomposite thermal stability.
 These results are in agreement with the fact that available nanoparticles are generally in the form of agglomerates and it is rather hard to be dispersed in their original dimensions, due to the strong interaction among them [bib0010]. On the basis of SEM micrographs, the supposed polystyrene/silica nanocomposite structure is given in drawings of agglomerated nanoparticles dispersed in a polystyrene matrix ([fig0015]).']], ['Thermal stability of unfilled and filled polystyrene', ['As it is well known, TG/DTG and DSC are widely used methods to investigate the thermal stability of the materials and to determine the thermal properties of polymer nanocomposites.
 Examples of such an experiment are presented in [fig0020] showing TG/DTG and DSC curves for pure polystyrene matrix and for sample reinforced with 2wt.
 In the temperature range from 175°C to the onset temperature a mass loss is observed in TG curve (11.5%) which is characteristic for the pure polystyrene [bib0120].', 'For polystyrene films the decomposition onsets are 397±5°C with the corresponding DTG peak temperatures (<i>T</i>max) at 429±6°C (see [tbl0005]).', 'The value of non-volatile residue determined by thermogravimetry confirms the weight percent of silica incorporated in the polystyrene matrix.
 It is followed by depolymerization and formation of the main evolved products (styrene monomer, dimer, and trimer) [bib0125 bib0130].', 'DSC curves show that the decomposition of all the samples is accompanied by one endothermic reaction in the temperature range from 375 to 490°C, probably as a consequence of the departure of polystyrene, as a volatile product.
', 'It is found that the highest thermal stability of the polystyrene is achieved at 18wt.
 [bib0135]. In some cases polymer nanocomposites show an increase of the <i>T</i>g [bib0140], but in other cases a decrease in <i>T</i>g is observed [bib0005 bib0015 bib0145 bib0150]. Typical thermograms of total specific heat flow versus temperature for polystyrene and five filled nanocomposites with silica particles are presented in [fig0025]. The values of <i>T</i>g, marked in [fig0025], are determined by middle point method.
 With the increase of the filler content the glass transition temperature is increasing from 94°C (for pure polystyrene matrix) to 99°C (for sample filled with 30wt.
 [eq0005] is proposed: (1)  T   g(x)=   T  g 0 +   x 1  +  k  x where <i>T</i>g is the glass transition temperature of the nanocomposites,   Tg   0   is the glass transition of the pure polystyrene and <i>x</i> is the silica content.
 The constant <i>k</i> depends on the silica type and it is obtained using the method of least squares (<i>k</i>=0.16).', 'The rate of change of polystyrene glass temperature is not significantly influenced by large agglomerates which presence is characteristic for the samples filled with higher silica content.
 [eq0005]).', 'The proposed equation describes well the experimental data with a correlation factor of 0.99 and a residual sum of squares value of 0.073. In [fig0030] it can be seen that the rate of polystyrene glass temperature change is decreased with increasing silica content.
