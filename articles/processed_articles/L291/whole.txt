Preparation and properties of poly(methylmethacrylate)–silica hybrid materials incorporating reactive silica nanoparticlesIn this study, poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA)-based hybrid materials were prepared from reactive silica nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were obtained by the reaction of 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl isocyanate with colloidal silica dispersed in ethyl acetate, and they were copolymerized in various ratios with methyl methacrylate. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and visible spectrometry were performed to evaluate the physical properties of the resulting hybrid materials. The PMMA–silica hybrid copolymers maintained high transparency, and their storage elastic modulus and surface hardness increased with increasing silica content. Moreover, in comparison with PMMA, the hybrid copolymers had greater heat resistance and lower volume contraction.['Organic–inorganic hybrid materials have been widely investigated in order to improve their matrix properties [bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5]. There have been many attempts using various techniques to develop high performance organic–inorganic hybrid materials, which combine the features of inorganic and organic substances.
 Such hybrid materials have been investigated at various scales from the level of microscale order to molecular order.
 Organic polymer materials exhibit excellent flexibility, toughness, moldability, and adhesiveness, but their heat resistance properties are inferior to those of inorganic materials.
 On the other hand, inorganic materials show high elastic modulus, heat resistance, corrosiveness, weather resistance, solvent resistance, and mechanical strength, but they are very brittle and their moldability is very poor.
 Organic–inorganic hybrid materials obtained by combining organic polymers with inorganic compounds at the nanoscale or molecular level, are expected to exhibit high performance in all properties.
 The materials properties of conventional organic–inorganic hybrid materials produced by mixing or dispersing inorganic materials in organic polymers are mainly determined by the nature of the interface between the organic and inorganic components, as well as by the size and dispersibility of the inorganic filler material. In order to obtain high performance hybrid materials, the inorganic component must be dispersed minutely and homogeneously in the organic polymer matrix, and there must also be good adhesion at the interface between the inorganic and organic components.
 However, in the conventional composite materials described above, poorer physical properties are often observed in the composite material when minute inorganic filler particles are used, due to the difficulty of achieving homogeneous dispersion.
 Because of the shortcomings of conventional composite materials, research has been widely conducted on organic–inorganic hybrid materials containing inorganic oxides such as silica, titania, and zirconia dispersed at the nanoscale in polymer matrices by the sol–gel method [bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10]. This method, which employs alkoxysilanes such as tetraethoxysilane, has been investigated extensively.
 However, the condensation temperature of the sol–gel reaction is limited by the thermal properties of the polymer matrix used in the hybrid material, that is to say, lower condensation temperatures in sol–gel reactions lead to incomplete condensation of Si–OH groups.
 The remaining Si–OH groups exert a deleterious influence on the transparency and thermal properties of the final hybrid material. To prevent this problem, several methods to introduce silica particles (with or without surface modification) into a polymer matrix have been reported [bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15]. Although properties such as elastic modulus and surface hardness were improved, a silane coupling agent such as γ-methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane still had to be applied in improve adhesion at the organic–inorganic interface.
', 'In this study, 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl isocyanate (MOI) was employed as the surface modifier and reactive silica nanoparticles were prepared by the reaction between the Si–OH groups of silica particles dispersed in ethyl acetate and the isocyanate groups of MOI.
 With this method, polymerizable groups could be introduced onto silica particles (thereby modifying the silica surface) without the generation of by-products such as alcohol or water, and without leaving a significant amount of residual Si–OH groups.
 The reactive silica nanoparticles were copolymerized with methylmethacrylate using benzoyl peroxide as an initiator to obtain hybrid materials whose physical properties were subsequently investigated.
 The aim of this study was to develop a novel organic–inorganic hybrid material with high mechanical performance.

[['Characterization of reactive silica nanoparticles', ['[fig1] shows the IR spectrum of reactive silica nanoparticles.
 Peaks attributed to CO of urethane (1685cm−1), N–H of urethane (1542cm−1), unsaturated double bond (1638cm−1) and ester unit of MOI (1721cm−1) were observed in the IR spectrum.
 [fig2] displays the 1H NMR spectrum, along with the assignment of each peak, of the reactive silica nanoparticles in acetone-<i>d</i>6. As can be seen from this figure, all peaks originating from the MOI unit were confirmed.
 The amount of MOI that reacted, as determined by NCO titration, was 1.68mmol/g of colloidal silica.
 [tbl2]summarizes the visible light transmittance data for the PMMA–silica hybrid copolymer and PMMA at 600 and 700nm.
 All the hybrid copolymers evaluated in this study kept high visible light transmittance, over 85% at each wavelength, compared to about 91% for PMMA.
 [fig3]shows TEM photographs of PMMA–silica hybrid copolymers containing 20 and 50wt% of reactive silica nanoparticles.
 [fig4]illustrates the temperature dependence of the storage modulus (<i>E</i>′) and tan   <i>δ</i> of these copolymers.
 <i>E</i>′ (at 30°C) increased from 3.8GPa for PMMA to 7.4GPa for a hybrid containing 50wt% of silica nanoparticles.
 <i>E</i>′ (at 30°C) of reference sample prepared using colloidal silica, which does not react with MOI is lower (4.6GPa) than that of hybrid copolymer at same colloidal silica content (50wt%). As for tan   <i>δ</i>, it was found that the peak intensity was reduced with increasing nanoparticle content, indicating that the mobility of the polymer network was reduced in the hybrid materials.
 The variation of Vickers hardness (<i>H</i>   v) as a function of nanoparticle content in the hybrid copolymer is listed in [tbl3]with the value of reference sample.
 The Vickers hardness of the hybrids also increased with increasing nanoparticle content in the same manner as <i>E</i>′, and became 1.88 times that of raw PMMA (from 196 to 363MPa at 50wt% nanoparticles). The value of reference remained at 313MPa.
']], ['Dimensional stability of PMMA–silica hybrid copolymers', ['The density of these materials before and after polymerization, and their volume contraction at various nanoparticle contents are summarized in [tbl4]   . The densities before polymerization increased with increasing nanoparticle content, as did the densities of PMMA–silica hybrid copolymers.
 The increment of the densities after polymerization was not so large and, therefore, does not detrimentally affect the lightness, which is an advantage of the polymer material. Alternatively, the volume contractions of PMMA–silica hybrid copolymers calculated from these values (<i>ρ</i>   m and <i>ρ</i>   p) decreased with the increase in nanoparticle content, and the volume contraction was smaller (12.8% at 50wt% nanoparticles) than that of unmodified PMMA (20.6%). The volume contraction was calculated from <i>ρ</i>   m and <i>ρ</i>   p as described in the [sec2] above.

 Moreover, around 400°C, at which temperature residual PMMA was completely degraded, the copolymers showed higher residual weights than their silica contents.
