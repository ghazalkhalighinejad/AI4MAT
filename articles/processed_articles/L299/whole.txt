Synthesis and properties of fluorine-containing polybenzimidazole/silica nanocomposite membranes for proton exchange membrane fuel cellsNovel polybenzimidazole (PBI)/silica nanocomposite membranes were prepared via sol–gel process from an organosoluble, fluorine-containing PBI copolymer with a silica precursor, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), and a bonding agent. The introduction of the bonding agent results in the reinforced interfacial interaction between PBI chains and silica nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses showed that the silica particles were well dispersed in the PBI matrix on a nanometer scale. The thermooxidative stability of the PBI membranes increased slightly with the increase of silica content. The coefficients of the thermal expansion (CTEs) of the nanocomposite membranes decreased slightly with increasing amounts of silica. The mechanical properties and the methanol barrier ability of the PBI films were improved by the addition of silica. The modulus of the PBI/10wt.% silica nanocomposite membranes had a 37% increase compared to the pure PBI films, and the methanol permeability decreased by 58% with respect to the pure PBI membranes. The conductivities of the acid-doped PBI/silica nanocomposites were slightly lower than the acid-doped pure PBI.['Proton exchange membranes (PEMs) have received a lot of attention in recent years, because they are the most important part in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). PEMs function as conductive proton mediums, as well as barriers to avoid direct contact between the fuel and oxidant.
 In order to alleviate the effect of CO poisoning in electrodes and to improve the power density of the fuel cells, the operating temperature has been proposed to be maintained above 100°C.
 The perfluorosulfonic acid polymer membranes, such as Nafion®, are typically used as the electrolytes in PEMFCs, because of their outstanding chemical stability and high proton conductivity.
 However, the Nafion® membranes have two major drawbacks: (i) loss of proton conductivity at temperatures above 100°C due to dehydration phenomena; (ii) high methanol permeation, which causes loss of fuel and decreases cathode performance in PEMFCs [bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7]. Polybenzimidazole (PBI) is a very promising material for high-temperature (>100°C) fuel cell applications, because of its high thermal stability and good mechanical properties.
 In addition, PBI doped with strong acids has stable proton conductivity at temperatures higher than 100°C [bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15 bib16].', 'The preparation of hybrid organic–inorganic composites has been developed and studied during the last decade, because hybrids show controllable chemical and physical properties by combining the effects of organic polymers and inorganic compounds [bib17 bib18 bib19 bib20 bib21 bib22 bib23]. Several studies have showed that the presence of silica particles in the organic polymer matrix can reduce the methanol permeability of the hybrids due to the dispersed silica particles acting as methanol barriers [bib24 bib25 bib26]. Therefore, the polymer/silica hybrid membranes have the potential for use as PEMs.
', 'In this study, we have prepared novel PBI/silica hybrid membranes using a silica precursor, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), via a sol–gel process in a PBI solution, followed by solution casting.
 The PBI used in this research is an amorphous, organosoluble fluorine-containing PBI.
 Compared to the most commonly PBI used in PEMFCs, poly[2,2′-(<i>m</i>-phenylene)-5,5′-bibenzimidazole], which is difficult to dissolve in common organic solvents due to its very rigid molecular structure, the fluorine-containing PBI is soluble in several organic solvents.
 It could be used to prepare PBI/silica hybrid membranes through the sol–gel process.
 However, the great difference in the properties of polymer and silica materials may cause phase separation.
 In order to avoid phase separation, some papers have reported that a bonding agent can be added to bond the organic moiety and the inorganic phase [bib27 bib28 bib29]. To achieve this objective, a fluorine-containing PBI copolymer containing hydroxyl groups was synthesized in this research to provide the bonding sites for the bonding agent.
 The fluorine-containing PBI copolymer had good compatibility with the inorganic silica phase.
 Here, we report the mechanical properties, thermal properties and methanol permeability of the PBI/silica hybrid membranes.
 The proton conductivities of these hybrid films doped with phosphoric acid were also examined.

[['Synthesis and characterization of PBI and PBI/silica nanocomposites', ['Fluorine-containing PBI was synthesized from 3,3′-diaminobenzidine, 2,2-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane, and 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid.
 The purpose of using the 2,2-bis(4-carboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropane monomer was to modify the properties of PBI, such as the flexibility, solubility and processability.
 The 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid monomer was introduced to provide the bonding sites to the bonding agents.
 However, according to the study of Chen et al. [bib32], phosphate ester could be formed between the hydroxyl groups and PPA.
 The inherent viscosities of PBI10OH and PBI30OH were 1.8 and 1.4dL/g, respectively, which were measured in DMAc at a concentration of 0.5g/dL at 30°C, indicating that the two PBI copolymers had high molecular weights.
 The formation of the PBI copolymers was confirmed by the IR and 1H NMR spectra, as shown in [fig2 fig3]. The PBI10OH and PBI30OH exhibited characteristic IR absorption bands at 3400–3100cm−1 due to the N–H and O–H groups, and an absorption band at 1625cm−1 due to the CN absorption.
 The 1H NMR spectra of PBI copolymers were measured in deuterated dimethylsulfone.
 The imidazole proton peaks of PBI10OH and PBI30OH were observed at 13.1–13.3ppm, and the hydroxyl protons were observed at 10.1–10.3ppm.
', '[tbl1] summarizes the qualitative solubility of the PBI copolymers.
 PBI10OH and PBI30OH were soluble in several organic solvents.
 [fig4] shows the WAXD patterns of PBI10OH and PBI30OH.
 This indicates that the two PBI copolymers are amorphous due to the bulky –(CF3)2 groups in the backbones.
 The absence of crystallization in the PBI copolymers was beneficial for dissolution in organic solvents and for proton conductivity [bib33 bib34].', 'Some papers reported that the condensation between the hydroxyl group of the polymer and silanol generated by hydrolysis of TEOS was difficult due to the poor reactivity of aromatic hydroxyl group with silanol [bib35 bib36]. For this reason, bonging agents were introduced to form covalent bonds between the PBI copolymers and silica.
 The formation of bonds between the PBI copolymers and bonging agents was indicated by the absence of the –NCO absorption band of the isocyanato group on the bonding agent (2270cm−1), the presence of weak CO stretching band of the urethane group (1725cm−1) and the –(CH2)-absorption band of the bonding agent (3000–2900cm−1), as shown in [fig2].']], ['Morphology of PBI/silica nanocomposite membranes', ['TEM micrographs of PBI10OH/10 and 15wt.

 The measurement was taken at 160°C under anhydrous condition, because the conductivity of the acid-doped PBI decreased above 160°C due to the dehydration of the phosphoric acid, which turned into H4P2O7. Compared with that of the acid-doped PBI membranes, the conductivity of the Nafion® 117 membrane declined abruptly above 80°C, because of dehydration.
 The conductivity of the Nafion® 117 membrane could not be measured at 160°C, because it lost proton conductive ability above 100°C.
 The above-mentioned detail was discussed in our previous research [bib40]. The conductivities of the acid-doped PBI30OH/silica nanocomposite membranes increased with the doping level of phosphoric acid.
 However, the conductivities of the nanocomposite films were slightly lower than that of the acid-doped pure PBI30OH membranes, because the silica particles in the polymer matrix might retard the mobility of protons in the membranes.
