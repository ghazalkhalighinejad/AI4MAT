Dielectric properties of BST/polymer compositeA composite of barium strontium titanate (BST) and thermoplastic cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) was investigated with different BST loadings using common and nanosize ceramic powders. The relative permittivity and loss tangent of the composites were measured as a function of loading at 1GHz and as a function of temperature at 0.1MHz. A relative permittivity of 6.0 and a loss tangent of 0.0009 at 1GHz (room temperature) were obtained for a BSTc-COC composite with 25vol.% loading using common-size particles of BST. The values for a BSTn-COC composite loaded with 25vol.% of nanosize BST particles were 7.3 and 0.0023, respectively. A modified Lichtenecker logarithmic equation showed good correspondence with measured relative permittivity of the BSTc-COC composite, but especially at a higher loading level, the model failed with the BSTn-COC composite.['Materials used in microelectronic packaging have to simultaneously fulfill diverse requirements, like low dielectric loss, moderate relative permittivity and moisture absorption resistance, as well as a low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and high dimensional stability and mechanical stiffness.
[bib1]1  Ceramic–polymer composites, especially type 0-3, form a potential material group suitable for producing demanding and functional packages that combine the electrical properties of ceramic and the mechanical flexibility, chemical stability, and processing possibilities of polymers.
 The feasibility of these composites for use in piezoelectric and pyroelectric applications, flexible sensors, transducers, thick film dielectrics, embedded capacitors, tunable antennas and other multilayer RF devices has been studied.
[bib2 bib3 bib4]2–4  The research has mainly concentrated on epoxy-ceramic composites,[bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8]5–8  but also other polymers, such as PVDF,[bib9]9  P(VDF–TrFE),[bib10]10  silicon-rubber,[bib11]11  polyimide,[bib12]12  polyvinylchloride (PVC),[bib13]13  cyanoethylated cellulose polymer (CR-S),[bib14]14  polystyrene,[bib15]15  and polyurethane,[bib16]16  have been used.
 However, only a few composites that use thermoplastic polymers have been reported.
[bib17 bib18]17,18  These polymers have excellent chemical stability and good mechanical processing possibilties, as they can be net-shaped at elevated temperatures to make, e.
g.
 sheets or a 3D structure, using injection molding, lamination or extrusion.
 Thus, thermoplastic polymers are attractive candidates for 0-3 type ceramic–polymer composites.
', "The main goal of this research was to introduce a novel 0-3 type ceramic–polymer composite made of thermoplastic polymer (cyclic olefin copolymer, COC) with different loadings of ferroelectric barium strontium titanate (BST). Recently it has also been reported that the nanosize ceramic powders of 0-3 type ceramic–polymer composites could enhance the composite's loading and microstructure.
[bib19 bib20]19,20  Thus, an additional objective of the research was to examine how the dielectric properties differ when the particle size of the ceramic filler is decreased from micro to nano-scale.
 The loading effect of two different BST materials (Ba0.55Sr0.45TiO3 with micrometer-scale particles and Ba0.5Sr0.5TiO3 with nanometer-scale particles) on the microstructure and dielectric properties of the composite was analyzed and discussed.
"].
 The measured relative permittivity and dielectric loss of pure COC at 1GHz were 2.4 and 0.0001, respectively.
 The relative permittivity and loss tangent of the pure BST bulk (made with common-size Ba0.55Sr0.45TiO3 powder and sintered at 1400°C for 4h) measured at room temperature were 1757 and 0.001 at 0.1MHz, respectively.
', 'In addition to the electrical performance of the basic composite materials, the final properties of the 0-3 ceramic–polymer composite depend on the loading, particle size, size distribution, and microstructure[bib21]21  of the ceramic filler.
', 'The particle size of the common BST powder was in the range of 0.2–2μm, with an average size of ∼1μm, whereas the particle size of the nano-BST powder was <200nm.
 The BET surface area measurement gave SSA values of 7.8 and 13.7m2/g for the common BST powder and the nano-BST powder, respectively.
', 'Composites with different BST loadings in the range of 2.5–60vol.% were fabricated from common-size BST powder (BSTc-COC). Similarly, composites with BST nano-powder were manufactured (BSTn-COC) with a 2.5–33vol.% of BST.
 The microstructures (SEM images in the back-scattering electron mode) of the BSTc-COC composites with 10, 40, 60vol.% BST and BSTn-COC with 10vol.% BST are shown in [fig1] . Gradually increased loading of BST and homogeneously distributed ceramic particles can be clearly seen in the COC polymer matrix.
', 'The SEM image of BSTn-COC ([fig1]d) shows more uniform and delicate distribution of the ceramic particles and smaller distances between them compared with BSTc-COC with the same volume fraction of 10vol.% ([fig1]a). Therefore, the polymer matrix dominates the behavior of the BSTc-COC composite with higher loadings than the BSTn-COC composites, which will be discussed later on.
 However, mixing became more difficult at higher loadings, as also reported by others,[bib19]19  because of the effect of the high SSA and thus the larger ceramic volume.
', 'The relative permittivity of the BSTc-COC composites at 1GHz rapidly increased from 2.6 to 21.4 as the volume fraction of BSTc was increased from 2.5 to 60vol.%, as shown in [fig2]a.
 The increase became more profound when the loading level of 25vol.% was exceeded.
 As the loading increased, a slow increase of the loss tangent at 1GHz from 0.001 to 0.003 was also observed.
 Their relative permittivity and loss tangent increased when the volume fraction of nano-BST powder was increased ([fig2]b), but at lower loading of BST (≤10vol.%) their dielectric properties are dominated by the main continuous phase of the polymer matrix.
 Differences occur at higher BST loading (>10vol.%), where the relative permittivity and losses of the composite increase more rapidly with the addition of nano-powder than with common powder.
 For example, composites with 10vol.% loading of common and nano-BST powders had the same relative permittivity of 3.5, but at 15vol.% and 25vol.% BST loadings the BSTc-COC had a relative permittivity of 3.9 and 6.0, whereas the BSTn-COC had a relative permittivity of 4.4 and 7.3, respectively.
 Correspondingly, the loss tangent of the BSTc-COC was 0.0005 and 0.0009 at 15 and 25vol.% BST loading, while for the BSTn-COC, values of 0.0010 and 0.0023, respectively, were measured.
 Thus, the nano-powder significantly increased relative permittivity when the BST loading was above 15vol.%, but it also generated higher losses.
[bib22]22  However, more research is required on this topic.
 An abnormal decrease in the loss value of BSTn-COC with 33vol.% of BST also requires further investigation.
[bib14 bib23]14,23log \u2009 ε = log \u2009 εp  + vb  ( 1 − k ) log   εb  εp where <i>k</i> is a fitting constant of the composite, <i>v</i> b the volume fraction of ceramic, and <i>ɛ</i> p and <i>ɛ</i> b are the relative permittivities of pure polymer and ceramic, respectively.
 For <i>k</i>, a value of 0.3 for well-dispersed polymer–ceramic composites has been reported.
[bib23]23  For our composites, <i>k</i> =0.43 was used, and the relative permittivities of the pure BST bulk and COC polymer were 1760 and 2.4, respectively.
 The modified Lichtenecker equation showed very good correspondence with the measurement results of the BSTc-COC composite ([fig2]a) up to relatively high loadings.
 In the case of the BSTn-COC composite, the equation shows good matching with measurement results at a ≤10% volume fraction.
[bib19 bib22 bib24]19,22,24  Other models especially made for nanocomposites, such as the interphase power law model (IPL model),[bib24]24  need to be used.
', 'The relative permittivity and loss of the BSTc-COC composite with 40vol.% of BST as a function of temperature (from −165 to 22°C) at 0.1MHz is shown in [fig3] . The results show that the Curie peak is hard to define, which is understandable since the ceramic loading was still relatively low.
