Improved thermal conductivity for chemically functionalized exfoliated graphite/epoxy compositesChemically functionalized exfoliated graphite-filled epoxy composites were prepared with load levels from 2% to 20% by weight. The viscosities of the composites having load levels >4% by weight were over the processing window for the vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding process. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction revealed a rhombohedral carbon structure in the filler. Enhanced interaction between the epoxy and the graphite filler was evidenced by an improvement in the rubber modulus for the chemically functionalized graphite/epoxy composites. The thermal and electrical properties of the nanoparticle-filled epoxy composites were measured. The electrical property of the chemically functionalized graphite/epoxy composite deteriorated. Thermal conductivity of the chemically functionalized graphite/epoxy composite, however, increased by 28-fold over the pure epoxy resin at the 20% by-weight load level, increasing from 0.2 to 5.8W/mK.['The quest for improvement of thermal conductivity in aerospace structures is gaining momentum.
 This is even more important as modern day aerospace structures are embedded with electronics which generate considerable amounts of heat energy.
 This generated heat, if not dissipated, might potentially affect the structural integrity of the composite structure.
 The use of polymer-based composites in aerospace applications has also increased due to their obvious superior specific properties, but the thermal conductivity of the polymer matrix is very low and not suited for the thermal design loads in many aerospace applications.
 Several research studies have been conducted to improve the thermal conductivity of the polymeric composites.
 Different fillers have been used to improve the thermal conductivity of the polymeric matrix [bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15]. Fillers may be in the form of fibers or in the form of particles uniformly distributed in the polymer matrix.
 The thermophysical properties of fiber-filled composites are anisotropic, except for the very short, randomly distributed fibers; while the thermophysical properties of particle-filled polymers are isotropic.
 Numerous studies have also been conducted in recent years, where nanoparticles have been dispersed in the polymeric matrix to improve the thermal conductivity.
 Putnam et al. [bib14] used the 3ω method to study the thermal conductivity of composites of nanoscale alumina particles in polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) matrices in the temperature range 40–280K.
 It was observed that the addition of 10% by weight of 60nm alumina particle filler decreased the thermal conductivity of the composite.
 Kuriger and Alam [bib7] studied the thermal conductivity of aligned, vapor-grown carbon fiber-reinforced polypropylene composite.
 They measured thermal conductivity with a laser flash instrument in the longitudinal and transverse directions for 9%, 17% and 23% fiber reinforcements by volume.
 The values of thermal conductivity as reported by them were 2.09, 2.75, 5.38W/mK for the longitudinal direction and 2.42, 2.47, 2.49W/mK for the transverse direction, respectively, while the thermal conductivity of unfilled polypropylene was 0.24W/mK.
 Exfoliated graphite platelets are another filler material of promise for improving the thermomechanical properties of the polymeric matrix.
 Aylsworth [bib16 bib17] developed and proposed exfoliated graphite as a reinforcement of polymers in 1910s.
 Lincoln and Claude [bib9] in 1980s proposed the dispersion of intercalated graphite in polymeric resins by conventional composite processing techniques.
 Since that time, research has been conducted on exfoliated graphite-reinforced polymers using graphite particles of various dimensions and a wide range of polymers.
 Kalaitzidou et al. [bib6] have demonstrated the use of exfoliated graphite platelets to enhance the thermal and mechanical properties of polymeric resins.
 They concluded that composites made by in situ processing have better mechanical properties compared to composites made by melt-mixing or other ex situ fabrication methods due to better dispersion, prevention of agglomeration and stronger interactions between the reinforcement and the polymer.
 Debelak and Lafdi [bib3] dispersed exfoliated graphite flakes in an epoxy resin and studied the thermal and electrical properties of the composites.
 A 24-fold increase in thermal conductivity was reported for the 20% graphite flake composite compared to the pure resin.
 Ma et al. [bib18] studied the effects of silane functionalization of multiwall carbon nanotubes on properties of CNT/epoxy composites.
 Their results indicated that grafting silane molecules onto a nanotube surface improved dispersion of the nanotubes in the epoxy matrix, thereby improving the interfacial interactions.
 These improved interfacial interactions resulted in improved mechanical and thermal properties.
 The study reported a decrease in electrical properties due to wrapping of the insulative silane molecules on the tubes.
 With respect to the prior work reviewed above, in this study we chemically treat the graphite flakes to make them compatible with the epoxy system and study the thermal, electrical and flow properties of the resultant composites.
 The thermal conductivity measurements performed in this study were by the laser flash diffusivity method.
 The laser flash method used to determine thermal property in this study has and is being used widely in the literature [bib19 bib20 bib21 bib22 bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27 bib28]. The studies reviewed [bib3 bib7] also used the same technique to determine thermal conductivity.
 Especially, Debelak and Lafdi [bib3] worked on a very similar system and the same measurement technique.
 Their results have been compared to the ones from our study.

[['Thermomechanical properties', ['The thermomechanical properties of the synthesized composites were measured by a TA DMA 2980 at 1Hz frequency, 10μm amplitude.
 The temperature range at which the samples were evaluated was 35–225°C, and the heating rate was 5°C/min.
 The tan <i>δ</i> plots for the unmodified graphite platelet composites are presented in [fig8]. The peak of the tan <i>δ</i> curve provides the glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>g) of the polymer.
 We observe that the <i>T</i>g of the pure epoxy resin is about 155°C.
 With the addition of 2% and 4% untreated exfoliated graphite platelets, the <i>T</i>g rises to about 165°C.
 With a further 4% addition of the graphite platelets, the <i>T</i>g rises to 175°C.
 At 20% graphite platelet loading, the <i>T</i>g drops drastically.
', 'The tan <i>δ</i> plots for the chemically treated graphite platelet composites are presented in [fig9]. A 7% rise in the <i>T</i>g is observed for the 2%, 4% and 8% composite.
', 'The storage modulus plots for the exfoliated and silylated graphite composites are presented in [fig10 fig11], respectively.
 At 20% loading level, the rubbery modulus for the silylated graphite composites is ∼240MPa, while that for the exfoliated graphite composites is ∼100MPa.
 [fig12]shows a series of patterns for the exfoliated flakes showing an increase in the crystalline graphitic content as the amount of flakes was increased (the patterns normalized to give the same amount of amorphous epoxy scattering).', 'One can observe several extraneous peaks in [fig12] not normally observed in graphite.
 Normal hexagonal (2H) graphite has alternating graphene layers in an ABABAB stacking sequence.
 Off-axis reflections (<i>h</i>  <i>k</i>  <i>l</i>) are only observed in 3D graphite, and many are observed as indicated in [tbl3]   . The extraneous peaks were first reported by Lipson and Stokes [bib29]. A small amount of rhombohedral (3R) graphite exists in natural graphite due to a stacking defect producing the ABCABC stacking sequence.
 Grinding has been known to produce more of this 3R phase [bib30] and is apparently present in significant amounts in the graphite flakes used in this study.
 [tbl3] shows the experimentally observed peaks and the corresponding peaks for both hexagonal (2H) and rhombohedral (3R) graphite.
', '[fig13]shows two patterns, one from the functionalized graphite flakes and the other from the exfoliated only graphite flakes.
 Based on the relative heights of the peaks between 42° and 47°, the exfoliated graphite flakes have more of the rhombohedral phase than the functionalized flakes, but both contain a significant portion.
 The 2H (100) peak occurs at 42.5° and the (101) at 44.7°, while the 3R (101) peak occurs at 43.5° and the (012) at 46.3°. All the flakes had graphitic <i>d</i>-spacings of ∼3.355Å with crystallite sizes greater than 300Å. More precise crystallites sizes could not be measured due to the instrumental broadening of the diffractometer.

 The SEM micrographs for the EG composite and the silylated EG composite are presented in [fig14 fig15]  , respectively.

 These laser parameters resulted in approximate laser energy of 6.13J incident on the specimen surface.
 The reference used for the heat capacity calculation was a 5-mm-thick specimen of POCO graphite.
 This instrument and method conform to ASTM E1461-92, “Standard Test Method for Thermal Diffusivity of Solids by the Flash Method” for the measurement of thermal diffusivity.
', 'The result of the thermal diffusivity test is presented in [tbl4]. The thermal conductivities of the different specimens as measured by the LFA 457 have been plotted and are reported in [fig16]. The thermal conductivity of the pure Epon 862/W epoxy resin is around 0.2W/mK.
 The thermal conductivity of the epoxy resin barely changes with the addition of 2% and 4% untreated exfoliated graphite flakes.
 At 8% loading, the thermal conductivity increases from 0.2 to 0.5W/mK.
 As the filler concentration is further increased to 16%, the thermal conductivity increases 9-fold to ∼2W/mK.
 Thermal conductivity increases 19-fold compared to the pure resin (0.2W/mK) to 4W/mK with a filler concentration of 20%. The thermal properties of the chemically modified graphite flake composites exhibit similar behavior to the untreated composites at low filler levels (until 4% loading). At 8% filler concentration, the thermal conductivity value of the treated composites is nearly double that of the untreated composites.
 Addition of 20% treated graphite flakes in the epoxy resin increases the thermal conductivity of the epoxy resin to 5.8W/mK – a 28-fold improvement.
', 'Debelak and Lafdi [bib3] reported thermal conductivity of exfoliated graphite–epoxy composites with graphite fillers of three different sizes.
 In their study, they used filler sizes of 297, 150 and 90μm.
 The highest thermal conductivity achieved in that study at 20% filler loading for all the different sizes was 4.3W/mK.
 In comparison the silylated graphite composites at 20% loading level had a thermal conductivity of 5.8W/mK, a 35% increase due to the silylation of the graphite flakes.
']], ['Electrical property study', ['The electrical resistivity curve for the graphite/epoxy composites is presented in [fig17]. The electrical resistivity measurements were performed by a 4-point probe technique.
 Epoxy resin without any conductive filler is essentially insulative with a resistivity of 1.58×108Ωcm.

 At 8% filler loading, the electrical resistivity for the treated composites was double that of the untreated graphite composites.
