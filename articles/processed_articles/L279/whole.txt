PMMA–titania nanocomposites: Properties and thermal degradation behaviourTitania nanoparticles were prepared using a sol–gel method and calcination at 200 and 600 °C in order to obtain anatase and rutile phases, respectively. The obtained powders were used to prepare PMMA–titania nanocomposites by a melt compounding method. The effect of the crystalline phase and the amount of titania, in the range 1–5 wt.%, on the morphology, mechanical properties and thermal degradation kinetics of PMMA was investigated by means of X-ray diffractometry (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C{1H}CP-MAS NMR), including the measurement of proton spin–lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (<i>T</i>
                     1ρ(H)), in the laboratory frame (<i>T</i>
                     1(H)) and cross polarization times (<i>T</i>
                     CH), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Results showed that both types of titania were well dispersed in the polymeric matrix, whose structure remained amorphous. The two types of nanoparticles influenced the degradation of the polymer in different ways because of their different carbon content, particle size and crystal structures.['Incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles into a polymer matrix has led to composites with improved thermal and mechanical properties [bib1 bib2 bib3]. There are a number of recent papers reporting on thermal degradation studies on poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) containing boehmite, alumina, iron oxide and different clays [bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9]. It was found that metal oxides have a pronounced effect on the morphology, as well as mechanical and thermal behaviour of PMMA.
 Some authors found that the well dispersed metal oxide nanoparticles in PMMA improved its mechanical properties, and increased its thermal stability and activation energy of thermal degradation [bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8]. These observations were attributed to strong interfacial interaction and stabilization of the free radicals by the inorganic compounds.
 However, Laachachi <i>et\xa0al</i>., in their investigation of PMMA nanocomposites with organically modified clays, found a decrease in the thermal stability of PMMA and attributed it to a catalytic effect of the clays on PMMA degradation [bib9].', 'The introduction of titania (TiO2) into a PMMA matrix received much attention due to improvements in the glass transition and thermal stability of the composites.
 Several methods have been used to prepare poly(methyl methacrylate)-titania (PMMA–TiO2) nanocomposites, including <i>ex-situ</i> sol–gel polymerization, radical polymerization and solution mixing [bib2 bib3 bib10]. For nanocomposites prepared <i>via in situ</i> bulk polymerization it was found that the presence of TiO2 retarded the thermal decomposition of the polymer [bib11]. This was attributed to the excellent interaction of the polymer chains with the TiO2 nanoparticles and the barrier effect to the evaporation of small molecules generated during the thermal decomposition of the PMMA matrix.
 The opposite trend, where the presence of TiO2 in a PMMA matrix did not enhance the thermal stability, was also observed and it was associated with the evaporation of physisorbed water [bib12]. Storage and loss modulus, glass transition temperature (<i>T</i> g), pendulum hardness and activation energy of the thermal degradation of the nanocomposites increased with increasing TiO2 content in PMMA–TiO2 nanocomposites [bib13]. It was also found that the presence of TiO2 in the PMMA matrix could lead to a decrease in <i>T</i> g  [bib2]. The decrease in this case was associated with significant formation of agglomerates and poor interaction.
 In another study the decrease in <i>T</i> g was attributed to the increased length of the polymer chains grown from the nanoparticles due to increased polymerization time [bib14].', 'PMMA–TiO2 nanocomposites prepared <i>via</i> solution mixing were also investigated [bib15 bib16]. The nanocomposites showed significant improvement in mechanical performance, thermal stability, glass transition temperature and activation energy of thermal degradation of the PMMA.
 Similar results were found for PMMA-TiO2 nanocomposites prepared through extrusion and rheometer mixing [bib17 bib18 bib19]. In these cases the titania was synthesized and modified by pure catechol. The improvement in the properties was attributed to good interfacial interaction and nanoparticles dispersion, which led to immobilization of the polymer chains.
 In contrast, the unmodified nanoparticles showed a decrease in glass transition which was linked to repulsive interaction with the surrounding polymer chains [bib15].', 'A review paper on the photoinduced reactivity of titanium dioxide [bib20] discusses the differences between anatase and rutile titania, all of which may cause the nanoparticles of these two titania phases to interact differently when incorporated into a polymer matrix.
 First of all the exposed planes of these nanoparticles are different because, although both anatase and rutile titania have octahedral structures, anatase titania can be regarded to be built up from octahedrals that are connected by their vertices, while in rutile titania the edges are connected.
 Further it was found that the anatase phase has a different oxygen vacancy than the rutile phase, as well as higher electron mobility, lower dielectric constant, lower density, lower deposition temperature and lower surface energy.
 Both these titania phases were found to have catalytic properties.
', 'Most of the reported studies concentrated on commercial anatase titania incorporated in PMMA, while little information was provided regarding incorporation of the rutile phase into PMMA.
 No systematic comparison of the properties of PMMA–TiO2 nanocomposites, containing respectively anatase and rutile titania, has been reported in literature.
 The purpose of this study was to prepare PMMA–TiO2 nanocomposites, containing anatase and rutile titania respectively, through melt compounding, and analysing the sample morphologies as well as their degradation and thermomechanical behaviour.

 The presence of rutile TiO2 did\xa0not significantly affect the <i>T</i>1ρ(H) values.
 The <i>T</i>1ρ(H) parameter is inversely proportional to the spectral density of motion in the kHz frequency region which reflects the dynamic behaviour of a polymeric chain in a range of a few nanometres.
 Larger <i>T</i>1ρ(H) values result from an increase in the stiffness of a polymer.
', 'The decrease in <i>T</i>CH values for the PMMA–TiO2 (anatase) composite indicates that there is an increase in the heteronuclear dipolar interactions between the carbons and the surrounding hydrogen nuclei.
 This is evidence that the presence of the anatase TiO2 into the PMMA matrix made the polymer structure more rigid.
 The presence of rutile TiO2 in PMMA gave rise to similar, but less intense, effects.

% of TiO2, are reported in [fig7 fig8]. The presence of anatase TiO2 does not show much influence on the storage and loss modulus at lower temperatures, but these values are observably higher above the glass transition ([fig7]a and b). This suggests that the particles immobilized the polymer chains at higher temperatures, probably due to the increase in rigidity (as observed from the NMR results), although the higher carbon content in the particles could also have played a role.
 [fig8]a shows that 1 and 2% rutile TiO2 reduced the storage modulus values between 40 and 90\xa0°C, probably because of a plasticizing effect of the titania nanoparticles on the PMMA matrix (the TEM results show less agglomeration in the case of the rutile titania nanoparticles), while 5\xa0wt.
% rutile TiO2 increased the storage modulus above the glass transition.
 The loss modulus curves follow the same trend ([fig8]b). Whatever the reason for the increased storage modulus, the difference in carbon content between the rutile and anatase phases, as confirmed through elemental analysis, could also have contributed to the differences in modulus.
', 'The glass transition temperature of PMMA generally increased in the anatase titania containing nanocomposites ([fig7]c). In the nanocomposites containing rutile titania, only the composite with 5% rutile titania showed a significant increase in the glass transition temperature.
 On the other hand, the <i>T</i>1H relaxation time values, which describe the dynamic behaviour of macromolecules within a larger scale, are slightly higher for the 95/5\xa0w/w PMMA–TiO2 (rutile) than for those of the neat PMMA and the PMMA–TiO2 (anatase) samples, suggesting an increase in matrix stiffness which is in line with the DMA results.
']], ['Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)', ['The TGA curves of all the samples are reported in [fig9]. They all show a single-step degradation and an increase in char content with an increase in the titania amount.
 Wang <i>et\xa0al.</i> [bib1], in their study of PMMA/silica/zirconia nanocomposites, explained the improvement in thermal stability as being the result of the formation of networks of polymer chains and inorganic moieties which may restrain the movement of free radicals.
 In another study on PMMA/titania nanocomposites [bib30] they confirmed their view of radical trapping being the main degradation stabilization mechanism.
 However, Laachachi <i>et\xa0al.</i> [bib31] proposed the restriction of polymer chain mobility as the mechanism for improvement in thermal stability.
', 'The isoconversional graphs of ln\xa0<i>β versus</i> 1/<i>T</i> and ln (<i>β</i>/<i>T</i>2) <i>versus</i> 1/<i>T</i> were plotted from the TGA curves of PMMA, 95/5\xa0w/w PMMA–titania (anatase) and 95/5\xa0w/w PMMA–titania (rutile) at heating rates of 3, 5, 7 and 9\xa0°C\xa0min−1. The activation energy values were calculated from the slopes of the isoconversional plots according to Equations [fd1 fd2]. Both isoconversional methods gave similar values of the activation energies within experimental uncertainty.
 The relationship between the activation energies and the degree of conversion is reported in [fig10]. These values fall within the range of activation energies for PMMA degradation reported previously [bib32 bib33]. The activation energy values of pure PMMA and its nanocomposites generally showed an increase with the degree of conversion.
 The increase in activation energy with an increase in degree of conversion during the degradation of polymers was observed and explained in several papers [bib32 bib33 bib34]. Gao <i>et\xa0al.</i> [bib33] gave an acceptable explanation for the change in activation energy with increasing degree of degradation for PMMA.
', 'The presence of anatase titania shows higher activation energy of degradation values between 20 and 70% weight loss than those of PMMA.
 The observation supports the increase in thermal stability of the PMMA–TiO2 (anatase) nanocomposites observed in TGA.
', 'TGA–FTIR analyses were done to establish the nature of the degradation product(s), and to confirm the observations from the kinetic analysis of the thermal degradation process of PMMA and 95/5\xa0w/w PMMA-titania.
 All the spectra almost perfectly match the known spectrum of methyl methacrylate (MMA), which confirms the primary degradation as that of de-polymerization ([fig11 fig12 fig13 fig14]). The peak around 2966\xa0cm−1 is assigned to the CH3 and CH2 stretching vibrations, whereas their bending vibration appeared around 1451\xa0cm−1 for CH2 and 1314\xa0cm−1 for CH3. The carbonyl absorption vibration appears around 1744\xa0cm−1 and the stretching vibration for C–O is around 1167\xa0cm−1. The peak at around 2336\xa0cm−1 is related to the asymmetric stretching mode of CO2. No new peaks or peak shifts were observed for the nanocomposite samples.
 It can be observed that at around 400\xa0°C the peaks of PMMA and the PMMA–TiO2 (rutile) nanocomposite start to disappear, while that of the PMMA-TiO2 (anatase) nanocomposite are still intense.
 It seems as if the volatilization of the degradation products is slower for the PMMA–TiO2 (anatase) nanocomposite, which implies more intimate contact between PMMA or MMA and anatase titania ([fig14]). This supports the improved thermal stability and higher activation energy of the PMMA–TiO2 (anatase) nanocomposite compared to the PMMA–TiO2 (rutile) nanocomposite.
