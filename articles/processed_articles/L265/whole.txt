Polyethylene multiwalled carbon nanotube compositesPolyethylene (PE) multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with weight fractions ranging from 0.1 to 10wt% were prepared by melt blending using a mini-twin screw extruder. The morphology and degree of dispersion of the MWCNTs in the PE matrix at different length scales was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). Both individual and agglomerations of MWCNTs were evident. An up-shift of 17cm−1 for the G band and the evolution of a shoulder to this peak were obtained in the Raman spectra of the nanocomposites, probably due to compressive forces exerted on the MWCNTs by PE chains and indicating intercalation of PE into the MWCNT bundles. The electrical conductivity and linear viscoelastic behaviour of these nanocomposites were investigated. A percolation threshold of about 7.5wt% was obtained and the electrical conductivity of PE was increased significantly, by 16 orders of magnitude, from 10−20 to 10−4
                     S/cm. The storage modulus (<i>G</i>′) versus frequency curves approached a plateau above the percolation threshold with the formation of an interconnected nanotube structure, indicative of ‘pseudo-solid-like’ behaviour. The ultimate tensile strength and elongation at break of the nanocomposites decreased with addition of MWCNTs. The diminution of mechanical properties of the nanocomposites, though concomitant with a significant increase in electrical conductivity, implies the mechanism for mechanical reinforcement for PE/MWCNT composites is filler-matrix interfacial interactions and not filler percolation. The temperature of crystallisation (<i>T</i>
                     c) and fraction of PE that was crystalline (<i>F</i>
                     c) were modified by incorporating MWCNTs. The thermal decomposition temperature of PE was enhanced by 20K on addition of 10wt% MWCNT.['The identification in 1991 of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by Iijima [bib1] has stimulated intense research interest in the structure [bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8], properties [bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12 bib13] and applications [bib14 bib15 bib16 bib17] of these unique materials.
 The intrinsic superconductivity [bib9], field emission behaviour [bib10], potential as molecular quantum wires [bib11], ability to store hydrogen [bib12], unusually high thermal conductivity [bib13], use as sensors for gas detection [bib16] and the biocompatibility and potential for biomolecular recognition [bib17] of carbon nanotubes has been reported.
 However, it is the combination of exceptional conductivity (electrical and thermal), low density and mechanical properties [bib16] of CNTs that has resulted in their use in filled composites.
 Both theoretical and experimental studies have shown CNTs to have extremely high tensile moduli (>1TPa for single walled carbon nanotubes, SWCNTs) and tensile strengths of the order of 500GPa [bib18 bib19]. Carbon nanotubes are thermally stable up to 2400°C in vacuo, have a thermal conductivity about double that of diamond and electric-current-carrying capacity 1000 times higher than copper wire [bib19]. The reported exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes have stimulated several groups to investigate both experimentally and theoretically the preparation and properties of polymer carbon nanotube composite materials.
 Polymer carbon nanotube composites will find many applications, most important of these will as structural materials due to their low density, where mechanical reinforcement or increased electrical conduction are required, as selectively permeable membranes, in electromagnetic induction shielding and in bio-molecule and drug delivery.
', 'Irrespective of the method of preparation there are two fundamental and critical issues associated with translating or transferring the unique properties of carbon nanotubes to a polymer matrix.
 Firstly, the nanotubes must be uniformly distributed and dispersed throughout the polymer matrix, and secondly, there must be enhanced interfacial interaction/wetting between the polymer and the nanotubes.
 For example, any load applied to the polymer matrix should be transferred to the nanotube.
 This load relies on the effective interfacial stress transfer at the polymer–nanotube interface, which tends to be polymer dependent [bib20]. Three general approaches have been adopted in attempts to modify the surface of CNTs to promote such interfacial interactions; chemical, electrochemical and plasma treatment.
 For example, Castaño et al. [bib21] placed different organo-functional groups on MWCNTs using an oxidation and silanization process.
 Haiber et al. [bib22] modified the surface of CNTs using low-pressure oxygen plasma treatment and using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) detected hydroxide, carbonyl and carboxyl functionality on the surface layers of the CNTs.
', 'There are several challenges to overcome with regard the processing of polymer carbon nanotube composites.
 Nanotubes, whether bundles of SWCNTs or aggregates of MWCNTs tend to agglomerate and its difficult to separate individual nanotubes during mixing.
 While high power ultrasonic mixers [bib23], surfactants, solution mixing [bib24] and in situ polymerisation have all been used to produce polymer carbon nanotube composites, these techniques have many limitations, including that they may not be commercially viable and are environmentally contentious.
 However, to date the preparation of polymer carbon nanotube composites using melt blending/extrusion has not been widely reported.
', 'Advani et al. [bib25] reported some improvements in stiffness and work to failure of HDPE/MWCNT composites that were prepared using a multi-step twin-screw extrusion procedure.
 Andrews et al. [bib26] using poor shear melt mixing, obtained modest increases in elastic modulus and a decrease in tensile strength for polypropylene, polystyrene and acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene (ABS)/MWCNT composites.
 CNTs have also been shown to alter the crystallisation kinetics of semi-crystalline polymers [bib27 bib28]. More recently, Shaffer et al. [bib29] melt blended polyamide-12 with MWCNTs and carbon fibres using a twin-screw microextruder, then produced fibres of the blends prepared.
 They highlighted that both the intrinsic crystalline quality of the nanocomposite and the orientation of the embedded CNTs are major factors controlling the reinforcing capability of CNTs.
 CNT reinforced Nylon-6 composites prepared by melt compounding having 120% improvements in tensile modulus and strength compared to virgin Nylon 6 was reported by Zhang et al. [bib30] Pötschke et al. have studied the morphology [bib31], electrical [bib32] and rheological [bib33] properties of polycarbonate (PC) based MWCNT composites and most notably obtained a 107 Ωcm reduction in volume resistivity for a PC/PE blend on addition of 0.41vol% MWCNT.
 In this paper we report the preparation of PE/MWCNT composites using melt blending and investigate the morphology and dispersion of MWCNTs in the PE matrix using a combination of microscopy, WAXD and Raman spectroscopy.
 The electrical conductivity of PE/MWCNT composites is measured, and combined with melt state oscillatory rheology measurements the percolation threshold for this system is determined.
 The mechanical, crystallisation and thermal decomposition properties of the nanocomposites are also discussed.

 [fig1] A–D shows the SEMs of bundled MWCNTs and typical cryo-fractured surfaces of PE with 10wt% MWCNT taken parallel and perpendicular to the flow direction, at ×5000 and ×30,000 magnification.
 [fig2]  shows a HRTEM image of a MWCNT protruding from the extrudate and coated with PE.
 The overall diameter of the MWCNT is about 20nm and individual internal walls of smaller diameter nanotubes are discernable.
 The AFM images shown in [fig3]  are from extrudate samples taken parallel to the flow direction during melt compounding for PE alone and for a typical PE/MWCNT nanocomposite.
 The XRD pattern for MWCNTs, shown in [fig4] , exhibits a sharp (002) Bragg reflection at about 2<i>θ</i>=26° and is derived from the ordered arrangement of the concentric cylinders of graphitic carbon [bib34]. This peak is absent from the XRD patterns of PE/MWCNT nanocomposites and greatly reduced in intensity for the 10wt% nanocomposite, further evidence for efficient mixing of the MWCNTs in PE.
 Furthermore, there is a broadening of and reduction in intensity of the 110 and 200 PE reflections with increasing MWCNT concentration, indicative of altered amorphous and crystalline phases.
 [fig5]  shows the high frequency Raman spectra for PE, MWCNT and PE with 0.1, 1 and 10wt% additions of MWCNT.
 In this part of the spectra the MWCNTs displayed two characteristic peaks, the first at 1306cm−1 assigned the D band and derived from disordered graphite structures, the second centred at 1594cm−1 assigned the G band and associated with tangential C–C bond stretching motions which originate from the <i>E</i> 2g2 mode at 1580cm−1 in graphite [bib35]. On addition of 1wt% MWCNT and greater, the maximum in the G band peak was up-shifted by 17cm−1 and the evolution of a shoulder peak was detected.
 Similar up-shifting of the G band, albeit much smaller than 17cm−1, has been reported for SWCNT reinforced epoxy resins [bib36 bib37] and polypropylene [bib38]. The up-shifting of the D and G bands is also a consequence of strong compressive forces associated with PE chains on MWCNTs.
 [fig6] A and B show volume resistivity and conductivity as a function of weight fraction of MWCNT in the PE matrix, respectively.
 The volume resistivity of the PE used in this study was 1020 Ωcm.
 Increasing additions of MWCNT from 0.1 to 10wt% resulted in an almost 16 orders of magnitude reduction in resistivity (increase in conductivity) to about 104 Ωcm.
 A significant drop in resistivity was achieved for a percolation threshold of about 7.5wt%. This threshold is somewhat greater than that obtained for other polymer carbon nanotube composites not prepared using melt compounding [bib31 bib39 bib40 bib41], but not unexpected as PE is one of the most electrically insulating of polymers.
 As the concentration of MWCNTs increases and assuming efficient mixing, the average distance between nanotubes decreases until a 3D interconnectivity of CNTs in the PE matrix is formed.
 The reduction in electrical resistivity for this PE on addition of MWCNTs was at least 10 orders of magnitude greater than that reported for composites of LDPE and nanoscale ZnO [bib42].', 'The percolation effect was further investigated by studying the melt state oscillatory rheology properties of the nanocomposites.
 It has been shown previously that the formation of a percolated system can be detected by characterising the complex viscosity (<i>η</i>*), storage modulus (<i>G</i>′) and loss modulus (<i>G</i>″) as a function of frequency [bib43 bib44 bib45]. [fig7]  shows the variation in complex viscosity <i>η</i>* with frequency for PE alone and the PE/MWCNTs nanocomposites.
 The size of the increase is more pronounced at lower frequencies (0.1rad/s) and is almost linear with nanotube content at higher frequencies (>10rad/s). The increase in complex viscosity with MWCNT content is concomitant with an increase in the storage moduli.
 The storage moduli for the nanocomposites show a monotonic increase at all frequencies with increasing MWCNT content, [fig8] . The largest increase was evident at lower frequencies, typically two orders of magnitude for 0.1rad/s, and is further evidence for the formation of a percolated network.
 The high frequency (>10rad/s) behaviour reveals little change in <i>G</i>′ with increased nanotube content.
 The <i>G</i>′ versus frequency curve for the nanocomposites with 8.5 and 10wt% MWCNT would appear to be approaching a plateau at low frequencies.
 It has been proposed that this ‘plateau’ effect is derived from interconnected structures of anisometric fillers that result in an apparent yield stress which is manifest by a plateau in either <i>G</i>′ or <i>G</i>″ versus frequency plots [bib43 bib46]. This low frequency response is indicative of ‘pseudo-solid-like’ behaviour, and has been seen for a conventionally filled polymer with strong interactions between filler and polymer and was attributed to yield phenomena in the composite [bib47 bib48]. The corresponding increase in the loss moduli (<i>G</i>″) is much lower than that for the storage moduli and there is no evidence for the formation of a plateau, as demonstrated in [fig9] . The loss moduli increased with increasing frequency and MWCNT content.
 Structural differences between the PE matrix and the nanocomposite can be detected by examining the relationship between <i>G</i>′ and <i>G</i>″. [fig10]  shows a plot of <i>G</i>′ against <i>G</i>″ for each nanocomposite.
 Pötschke et al. [bib42] reported similar behaviour for polycarbonate MWCNT composites.
 It is evident, particularly at lower frequencies that tan <i>δ</i> decreases and the corresponding curves becomes progressively flatter with increasing addition of MWCNTs, [fig11] . This behaviour is evidence for the presence of interfacial interactions between the PE and MWCNTs, and that both energy dissipation and relaxation of the PE chains are increasingly hindered as the MWCNT loading increased to 10wt%.', 'The mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were measured as a function of MWCNT loading and are shown in [fig12] . The yield stress (<i>σ</i> y) increased slightly as the loading of MWCNTs was increased up to 10wt%. However, both the ultimate tensile strength (<i>σ</i> b) and the elongation at break (<i>ε</i> b) decreased.
 The toughness of this PE was greatly reduced and addition of MWCNTs above 0.1wt% yielded increasingly brittle samples.
 The embrittlement of polymers on addition of CNTs is not unusual and has been reported previously for polar polymers also 40. This would suggest that any interfacial interactions between PE and the MWCNTs were at a level too low to have a positive effect on bulk mechanical properties.
 [fig13]  shows the variation in bending storage modulus (<i>E</i>′) for PE/MWCNT nanocomposites between 18 and 100°C.
 At lower temperatures <i>E</i>′ is increased by about 60% on addition of 0.5wt% MWCNT compared to neat PE, but falls to 15% with 7wt% addition.
 However, the temperature of crystallisation (<i>T</i> c) increased by about 8°C for the nanocomposite with 10wt% MWCNTs, indicating MWCNTs have a nucleating effect for this PE.
 [tbl1]  lists the DSC characteristics of PE and PE/MWCNT nanocomposites.
 The fraction of polymer within the nanocomposite that is crystalline, <i>F</i> c, was calculated from:   (1)  Fc  =Δ   H   293 f  p  where Δ<i>H</i> is the enthalpy of fusion (J/g), 293 is the enthalpy of fusion for a theoretically 100% crystalline PE [bib49] and <i>f</i> p is the weight fraction of polymer.
 The crystalline content of PE changes little on addition of 0.1wt% MWCNT, but decreases by about 5% when the loading of MWCNTs was increased to 10wt%. This reduction in crystalline content is in agreement with that observed in the WAXD patterns.
 PE has a single stage decomposition profile starting at about 400°C, which was unaltered when 0.1 and 1wt% MWCNTs were added.
 Interestingly, no small weight losses were detected below 400°C, suggesting that the MWCNTs had a low amorphous carbon content.
 The onset of degradation of PE was enhanced by about 20K for a 10wt% loading of MWCNTs.
