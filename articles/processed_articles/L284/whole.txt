Graphene oxide and base-washed graphene oxide as reinforcements in PMMA nanocompositesGraphene oxide (GO) prepared using the Hummers’ method is known to be composed of functionalized graphene sheets decorated by strongly-bound oxidative debris that can be removed by a simple base wash. The use of as-made GO and base-washed GO as reinforcing fillers in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanocomposites has been compared through dynamic mechanical thermal analysis and tensile testing. Nanocomposites with loadings from 0.5 to 10wt.% were produced by melt mixing using a twin screw extruder. Large shifts in the values of <i>T</i>
                     g for the nanocomposites with respect to PMMA suggest the presence of interactions between the GO and polymer. Thermogravimetric analysis also revealed a significant increase in the decomposition temperatures upon the addition of the GO. Optimal loadings of 1wt.% were found for both fillers, up to which substantial mechanical reinforcement was observed. Comparison with previous nanotube systems, suggests that there was a good dispersion of both fillers below 1wt.%, with aggregation and a deterioration of the mechanical properties occurring at higher loadings. Stress-induced shifts of the Raman D band in the GO revealed the existence of stress-transfer from the PMMA matrix to the fillers during deformation. Overall the as-made GO gave nanocomposites with better properties than those reinforced with based-washed material. Hence, it appears that the presence of the oxidative debris in GO, which acts as a compatibilising surfactant, is beneficial in producing nanocomposites with both a good dispersion and a strong interface between GO and a polymer matrix.['Graphene has attracted significant interest since its first isolation in 2004 [b0005] due to its extraordinary mechanical, thermal and electronic properties [b0010 b0015 b0020]. These properties make it an ideal material for a range of applications including sensors, batteries, supercapacitors, hydrogen storage and reinforcing fillers [b0025 b0030 b0035 b0040]. One route to harness these properties in a bulk material is to incorporate graphene into a polymeric composite material. A key challenge for the production of such nanocomposites is obtaining the appropriate dispersion of graphene within the polymer matrices [b0045]. Graphene is difficult to disperse in polymers as the graphene sheets tend to aggregate due to their high specific surface area, and van der Waals and <i>π</i>–<i>π</i> interactions [b0010 b0050 b0055]. Therefore, the surface modification of graphene to enhance its matrix compatibility is widely studied, with graphene oxide (GO) being a primary focus of research [b0060]. GO has a wide range of hydrophilic surface functionalities including carboxylic acids, epoxides and alcohols [b0255], which facilitate its exfoliation into single- or few-layer graphene oxide in water [b0070] and polar organic solvents [b0075 b0080] via sonication or stirring.
 Many groups have reported on GO reinforced polymer nanocomposites using hydrophilic polymers, such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) [b0085 b0090] or poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) [b0095 b0100 b0105]. Nanocomposites with GO have also been produced using hydrophobic polymers, including polystyrene (PS) [b0040 b0110] and polyurethane (PU) [b0115 b0120]. In the case of poly(methyl methacrylate) PMMA, three methods have been used to improve the PMMA–GO dispersion: (1) chemically modifying the surface of the GO to make it compatible with PMMA [b0125 b0130], (2) dispersing water–soluble PMMA in with the aqueous GO solution, so that nanocomposites could be solution cast [b0260] and (3) <i>in situ</i> polymerisation of the PMMA in the presence of GO [b0140 b0145 b0150 b0155].', 'Recently Rourke et al. [b0160] showed that as-made GO from Hummers’ method is actually composed of functionalized graphene sheets decorated by strongly-bound oxidative debris acting as a surfactant that stabilizes aqueous GO suspensions, as shown schematically in [f0005] . These physi-absorbed aromatic acids can be removed by a simple NaOH(aq) wash to give base-washed GO (bwGO) reducing the oxygen content from 33% to <20%, turning the hydrophilic nature of GO into hydrophobic, and improving the conductivity of films made from the material by 5 orders of magnitude.
 Flakes with similar sizes were found before and after washing, probing that the graphenes were not damaged or broken and there was no loss of small flakes during this washing.
 The presence of these physi-absorbed groups on GO could potentially lower the Young’s modulus of the flakes, as it effectively turns the flake into a few-layer material, providing an easy shear plane between the debris, attached to the polymer and reinforcing GO flake.
 (There is 25 % coverage of the debris on each side of flake.
) The effect of easy shear on the Young’s modulus graphene was illustrated by Gong et al. by the fact that trilayer graphene has a significantly lower modulus than monolayer graphene [b0165]. On the other hand, such debris may improve the interface between the GO and matrix by acting as a compatibilising surfactant forming an interphase between the polymer and filler.
 The debris may also improve the dispersion of the graphene oxide, hence the mechanical properties.
 A key question therefore, arises: <i>is it better to use as-made GO or base-washed, clean GO in nanocomposites?</i>', 'Herein, we compare for the first time as-made and base-washed graphene oxide materials as reinforcing fillers in PMMA to establish the relative roles of the interface and GO modulus.

 Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to determine the structural properties of the matrix of the neat polymer and nanocomposites.
 Electrical measurements, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and tensile testing were performed to study the electrical and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites, respectively, as a function of their structure, surface chemistry and dispersion in the polymer matrix.
 The nature of the interactions at the GO/bwGO-polymer interfaces were evaluated by Raman spectroscopy and related to the mechanical reinforcement of the nanocomposites observed upon the addition of the different types of GO.

[['Matrix properties', ['The weight average molar mass (<i>M</i>w) and the polydispersity index (<i>M</i>w/<i>M</i>n) of pure PMMA and the 10wt.
 The results reveal that <i>M</i>w for the PMMA was ∼105g/mol and that there was no significant difference between the nanocomposites compared to the virgin PMMA.
 The polydispersity index, however, increased by 18% and 26% for the GO and bwGO nanocomposites, respectively, implying that some limited chain scission may have occurred during nanocomposite processing.
', 'The non-oxidative thermal stability of the nanocomposites studied was evaluated by TGA and the curves obtained are shown in [f0010]. Although the weight loss curve profiles of the nanocomposites are very similar to that obtained for neat PMMA, considerable enhancement in the thermal degradation temperature (<i>T</i>d) by the incorporation of both GO and bwGO was observed.

', 'The observed improvement in thermal stability of these nanocomposites could be attributed to the formation of a high aspect ratio, heat-resistant GO/bwGO network in the polymer matrix that acts as a barrier inhibiting the emission of the decomposition products during combustion [b0225]. The homogeneously distributed graphene layers could prevent the emission of small gaseous molecules during thermal degradation, slowing the non-oxidative thermal degradation of the nanocomposites compared with neat PMMA.
 Interestingly, the more thermally-stable filler (bwGO) [b0160] gave nanocomposites with worse thermal stability.
']], ['Electrical conductivity', ['As-made GO is a poor conductor due to the presence of the strongly-bound oxidative debris but by removing the physi-absorbed aromatic acids the conductivity of GO films can be improved by 5 orders of magnitude [b0160]. Despite this improved conductivity measured for the base-washed material, the conductivity of the bwGO/PMMA system remained so low at all loadings studied that it could not be determined below the detection limit of 10−6S/m.
']], ['Dynamic-mechanical properties', ['The dynamic-mechanical response of the nanocomposites was determined and the temperature dependence of the storage modulus (<i>E</i>′) of GO/PMMA and bwGO/PMMA nanocomposites is plotted in [f0015]. An increase in the area under the DMTA loss peak (<i>E</i>″) with respect to neat PMMA was observed for all the nanocomposites studied ([f0015]b and d), suggesting an increased segmental mobility in the nanocomposites at <i>T</i>g independent of the nature of the filler.
 The glass transition temperature <i>T</i>g of the nanocomposites are increased substantially relative to neat PMMA and the (<i>T</i>g) values are plotted as a function of the filler loading in [f0015]e.
 This shows substantial increases relative to neat PMMA with maximum shifts of 12°C and 8°C for GO/PMMA and bwGO/PMMA nanocomposites, respectively, at the optimal loading (1wt.
 This could be due to either a chemical bond or an interaction between PMMA and the surfaces of the GOs [b0230 b0235 b0240].', 'The value of <i>E</i>′ increases with loading for both GO/PMMA and bwGO/PMMA nanocomposites until 1wt.

 [f0025]a shows that the D band for the GO can be resolved at around 1340cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the nanocomposites as has been found for a GO/PVA system [b0275]. The position of the Raman D band for both of the nanocomposites was found to shift to lower wavenumber with tensile strain as shown in [f0025]b.
 The observed shifts of the D band are due to stress transfer from the PMMA to the graphene oxide occurring at the interface between polymer and graphene oxide [b0275]. The low intensity of the D bands at low loadings combined with the large background fluorescence of GO meant that it was difficult to obtain reliable data for most samples, hence only the 10wt.
 Values of D band shift rates of 4cm−1/% and 2.4cm−1/% strain were observed for the GO/PMMA and bwGO/PMMA samples, respectively.
 The higher shift rate for the GO/PMMA nanocomposite implies better interfacial stress transfer for this material [b0275].']]].
