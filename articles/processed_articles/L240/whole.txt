Dielectric properties of zinc oxide/low density polyethylene nanocompositesZnO/low density polyethylene (LDPE) nanocomposites with either homogeneous or controlled inhomogeneous dispersions of ZnO nanoparticles were prepared. The dielectric constants of the composites with filler concentrations up to 40 vol.% were measured and compared with the dielectric constants of conventional submicron size ZnO filled LDPE composite. The filler particles were coated with silane coupling agents and mixed with LDPE to take advantage of the high surface area of nanoparticles for the introduction of high dipole moment molecules to the composite. The effect of filler distribution on the dielectric constant was also examined and the observed differences are attributed to the differences in the two kinds of interfaces present: one formed between the touching ZnO particles and the other formed between LDPE and ZnO.['Polymers are generally known to be good insulating materials due to their stable physical and chemical properties [bib1]. Both the mechanical and electrical properties of polymers, however, can be further improved or modified with the addition of inorganic fillers [bib2] as demonstrated by increases in the mechanical strength of the composite [bib3] and changes in the electrical conductivity [bib4 bib5]. It is known that the composite properties can also change with the dispersion state, geometric shape, and surface quality of the filler particles as well as the particle size.
 For example, Sumita et al. [bib6] studied the effect of carbon black dispersion in polymer blends on the electrical conduction properties of the composite, and the dependence of electrical properties on the shape and distribution of the filler particles was reported by Flandin et al. [bib7].', 'Owing to the recent commercial availability of nanoparticles, the outlook for composite materials with new or modified physical properties became even brighter.
 Nanoscale fillers are different from bulk materials and conventional micron-size fillers due to their small size and corresponding increase in surface area [bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11]. It is expected that the addition of nanoparticles into polymers would lead to unprecedented ability to control the electrical properties of filled polymers [bib12 bib13]. Furthermore, nanocomposite materials with length scales smaller than 1 μm are becoming necessary as the size of modern electronic devices reaches down to submicron scales.
 Therefore, understanding how to control the resistivity and permittivity of nanofilled polymer nanocomposites is an essential step toward the controlled engineering of nanocomposite materials in future electrical applications.
', 'In the present work, we attempt to understand the effects of filler particle size and spatial distribution on the permittivity of composites.
 Low density polyethylene (LDPE) was chosen as a representative polymer matrix because it is widely used for electrical insulation in the cable and wire industry owing to its high breakdown strength and resistivity [bib14]. Another advantage of LDPE is that it is relatively easy to mix with inorganic fillers by simple melt mixing; good dispersion of the filler particles is readily achieved [bib25]. ZnO fillers were used, since ZnO is a wide band gap semiconducting material well known for its nonlinear electrical conductivity properties and it has also been studied by many researchers [bib15 bib16 bib17]. By combining the special properties of ZnO nanoparticles [bib18 bib19 bib20] with LDPE, a polymeric nanocomposite material with controlled properties could be expected.
 The conductivity of ZnO is much higher than that of LDPE and is dominated by the properties of its surfaces [bib20]. The conductivity of the ZnO/LDPE composite is thus expected to change with the volume fraction of ZnO, as well as its particle size and particle surface chemistry.
 However, the detailed relationship between the filler concentration and the permittivity of the composite is still uncertain [bib2]. The behavior near the percolation threshold, <i>p</i> c (the filler concentration at which the resistivity starts to change rapidly), is also of interest [bib21]. Classical percolation theory predicts a steep increase in permittivity as the filler concentration increases past <i>p</i> c  [bib21 bib22]. However, <i>p</i> c and the dependence of permittivity on filler volume fraction are system and processing dependent [bib28 bib23 bib24]. The percolation behavior needs to be understood carefully with consideration of the physical conditions and properties of both filler and matrix that constitute the composite.

['The permittivity of the nanocomposites with homogeneous filler distribution was found to be roughly proportional to the volume fraction of ZnO particles in the composites, as seen in [fig2] . The Maxwell–Garnett approximation, ε  =  v   m   ε   m(   2   3+  ε d  3   ε m )+   v   d   ε   d v   m(   2   3+  ε d  3   ε m )+   v   d ,predicts the dielectric constant for a mixture of spherical particles with dielectric constant <i>ɛ</i> d dispersed in a matrix with lower dielectric constant, <i>ɛ</i> m, with volume fractions of <i>v</i> d and <i>v</i> m, respectively [bib26]. The trend shown in [fig2] is the same for both nanoparticle and micron-particle filled composites up to a filler concentration of 40 vol.% in spite of the much higher specific surface area of the nanoparticles.
 Up to 40 vol.%, rapid increase in dielectric constant was not observed, i.
, no percolation behavior was observed from the measurement of dielectric constant, although the same composite specimens used in this work exhibited percolation behavior in the measurement of electrical dc resistivity [bib27].', 'Although the ZnO/LDPE interfaces do not contribute to the bulk dielectric constant, the high surface area of the nanoparticles can be used to introduce extra organic material into the composite.
 This was demonstrated with composites at filler concentrations of 7 and 14 vol.% by coating the nanoparticle fillers with various coupling agents as shown in [fig2].', 'The temperature dependence of the permittivity of the composites with homogeneous filler distributions was also measured by placing the electrode and specimen in a silicone oil bath at elevated temperatures ([fig3] ). Pure polyethylene exhibited a slight decrease of permittivity as temperature increased.
 At about 4 vol.% of ZnO, the permittivity remained essentially constant over the temperature range tested, while for the 10 vol.% ZnO samples a measurable increase was observed at higher temperatures.
 The composites with the higher concentration of ZnO measured (40 vol.%) exhibited a strong increase of permittivity with temperature.
 This is in contrast to the slightly decreasing or almost constant permittivity with temperature of the insulating ceramic particle filled polymer composites observed by Dang et al. [bib28] and Yu et al. [bib29] The difference can be understood with consideration of the semiconducting nature of ZnO.
', 'The dielectric constant of the composites with inhomogeneous filler distributions was measured as a function of frequency ([fig4] ). The permittivity was measured to arise higher than that of the composite with homogeneous filler distribution at a given filler concentration.
 As a comparison, the permittivity of LDPE/14 vol.% ZnO composite with homogeneous filler distribution was plotted as a function of frequency in [fig4]. In the inhomogeneous composite, the filler particles are not well dispersed, but rather stay touching other particles forming interfaces between ZnO particles [bib30]. This is in contrast to the homogeneous composites in which all the nanoparticles stay separated from one another by polymer layers.
 The interface dipoles associated with ZnO/ZnO interfaces are thus apparently responsible for the increased permittivity in the frequency range below 10 kHz.
