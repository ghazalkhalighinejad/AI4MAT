How do graphite nanoplates affect the fracture toughness of polypropylene composites? From a mechanical perspective, graphene and its derivatives, such as graphite nanoplates, graphite oxide, carbon nanofibers, or nanotubes, are envisioned as ideal nanofillers for polymer composites. Thus, tremendous research effort has been invested to determine the reinforcing mechanism of these nanofillers in the matrix: crack bridging, crystallization enhancement, or crack deflection are some possible mechanisms that have been proposed. In this work, a detailed analysis of the fracture mechanism of graphite nanoplate (GNP)/polypropylene composites was performed. Commercially available graphite nanoplates, composed of multiple graphene layers stacked together, were used to produce polypropylene nanocomposites by following a masterbatch technique. The fracture toughness was determined by applying the Spb parameter method and the fracture mechanism was identified to be void nucleation and growth. We demonstrate how GNPs affect and improve the fracture toughness of polypropylene. This improvement is caused by the debonding of the GNP agglomerates, which promotes the matrix plastic deformation during the fracture process. Keywords Graphite nanoplates A.

Fractography [' In the last decade, graphene-based nanostructures have been extensively studied as part of a novel generation of composite materials.
 Their outstanding mechanical properties and extraordinary surface area make these nanoscale materials ideal as nanofillers.
 Although recent efforts have been made to scale-up the production of graphene [1] or modified graphene [2], only graphite nanoplates (GNPs), which consist of stacked graphene layers bound to each other by van der Waals forces, can currently be produced at the scales needed for use in composite materials and structural applications.
  The addition of a small amount of nanofiller can lead to a significant improvement in mechanical properties.
 Stiffness and strength can be enhanced when nanofillers are homogeneously dispersed [3] and there is a strong interphase between nanofillers and polymer matrix [4], [5]. Tremendous research effort has been invested to determine how the nanofiller affects the mechanical and fracture behavior of a polymer [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. The most effective way to toughen semi-crystalline polymers is the cavitation or nucleation of voids [12], [13]. One approach to achieve this toughening effect is the addition of nanoparticles.
 However, if these nanoparticles have a strong interaction with the host matrix then the cavitation or debonding and consequent void nucleation could be hindered [14]. Such materials would have extrinsic rather than intrinsic toughening mechanisms, i.
e.
, crack bridging [15], crack deflection [16], etc.
  One of the main problems in analyzing the effect of a nanofiller in a thermoplastic matrix is the difficulty of characterizing the fracture toughness.
 In the case of ductile polymers, fracture toughness is generally determined by the J-integral versus crack growth resistance (J–R) curve, in which the value of the J-integral is plotted against the crack extension.
 To measure the J–R curve, a multi-specimen technique is commonly used [17]. A set of pre-cracked test specimens of the same size, geometry, and material are tested until the crack grows to a certain length.
 As a single test is needed for each point of the J–R curve, a large number of tests and specimens are needed to obtain the whole curve.
 Additionally, in the case of polypropylene (PP), measurement of the crack extension is extremely difficult because of the presence of fine-scale fracture-surface features or microstructural inhomogeneities [18]. To overcome these drawbacks, Sharobeam and Landes proposed the Spb parameter method [19], [20], [21], in which the crack length is estimated indirectly throughout the whole mechanical test; only one single pre-cracked specimen plus one notched specimen are used to measure the whole J–R curve.
 This low material consumption makes this method ideal for materials produced in small batches, such as nanocomposites.
  In the work presented here, we analyze the toughening effect of graphite nanoplates in a polypropylene matrix made by a simple extrusion-compounding process, followed by an injection-molding process.
 The Spb parameter method is used to analyze the fracture toughness of the resulting PP/GNP composites.
 To identify the plastic deformation zone that appears ahead of the crack tip in the specimen during the fracture test, a full-field strain analysis is carried out by digital image correlation.
 The fracture mechanism is identified by scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis of the fracture surfaces.

['##3.1. Agglomerate size distribution and dispersion of the graphite nanoplates  The morphology of the as-received GNPs was characterized by using SEM (Fig.
 1a). The GNPs were in an agglomerated state.
 1a, the equivalent diameter and thickness distribution is shown.
 The agglomerates have an average equivalent diameter of 21 μm and an average thickness of 11 μm.

 1c reveals that in the material with 0.5 wt.
 The nanocomposite with 5 wt.
 1d), the highest nanofiller content produced in this study, contains more and bigger GNP agglomerates (with a diameter of between ca.
 20 and 50 μm) than those observed in samples with lower GNP amounts, as expected [7], [23], [24].  This analysis of the dispersion degree seems to indicate that the processing requires other parameters to achieve a higher dispersion degree of the agglomerates (e.
, melt temperature, mixing time, screw rotational speed, screw profile, and diameter) to promote their break up [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. Another approach to achieve the dispersion of the agglomerates would be to maintain the processing parameters but combining with other techniques as three roll mill, as suggested by Pötschke et al. [30] or adding extra steps (i.
, extrusion compounding). However, it has to be taken into account that re-agglomeration of the nanofiller can occur, which is thermally-driven and shear-induced during the re-melting of the material [24], [31]. ##3.2. DSC and DMA measurements  The thermograms obtained from the DSC measurements are shown in Fig.
 2a.
 There is no change either in the crystallization (123.9 ± 0.3 °C) or the melting (163.8 ± 0.6 °C) temperature and peak profiles upon the addition of nanofiller.
 The degree of crystallinity (Xc) of the nanocomposites was calculated by following (1) [32], [33]:(1) where ΔHs is the heat of fusion of the measured sample (obtained by integration of melting peaks [34]), ϕ is the weight fraction per unit of mass of the nanofiller, and ΔH0 is the heat of fusion of 100% crystalline PP, taken as 209 J/g [32], [35].  The degree of crystallinity of the matrix remained unaffected by the addition of nanofiller, with a value of 26.6 ± 0.3% for all the different weight fractions.
 These results agree with previously reported results and confirm that, although GNPs may act as a nucleating agents for PP crystallization [33], Xc does not change with the addition of the nanofiller.
 2b.
 The three characteristic relaxations of polypropylene, α, β, and γ, have been observed for the loss tangent, tan δ [36]. The α relaxation peak is related to the motion within the crystalline phase of PP, particularly to the diffusion of defects in the crystals [36]. The β relaxation peak is associated with the glass transition of the amorphous fraction of PP.
 Finally, the γ relaxation peak varies little with the crystallinity and has been attributed to local motions of the methyl groups within the amorphous phase of PP [36]. No significant changes are found in the relaxations described above for the different nanocomposites.
 Similar behavior was also observed in other thermoplastic/clay composites [37]. In the case of a PP/GNP nanocomposite [32], a reduction in the storage modulus was reported.
 ##3.3. Flexural and fracture toughness tests  Results obtained from three-point-bending tests (Fig.
 3a) show no significant effect on the flexural modulus and strength upon the addition of the GNPs to the PP matrix, which could be attributed to a low dispersion degree of the nanofiller and/or poor interfacial bonding and interaction between the polymeric matrix and the nanofiller [4]. However, there was a slight decrease in the flexural strength and modulus, for GNP content up to 1 wt.
 3b.
 The analysis of the fracture behavior of the GNP/PP nanocomposites shows that increasing the amount of GNPs, up to a maximum of 2.5 wt.
 An improvement of 25% is achieved for a loading of 1 wt.
 However, a further increase in the proportion of GNPs leads to a significant decrease in the crack growth initiation energy; the 5 wt.
% GNP nanocomposite has a fracture toughness that is 20% lower than that of neat PP.
 This decrease in mechanical properties for high volume fraction is expected and it is strongly related to the poor dispersion of the nanofiller in the matrix, as is widely reported in the literature [3], [5]. ##3.4. DIC study and SEM analysis of the fracture surfaces  The strain in the principal direction, ε1, was calculated by using digital image correlation analysis of the pictures taken during the fracture test.
 4b) and the nanocomposites with 1 and 5 wt.
 4c and d, respectively), at the moment of the crack growth initiation, shows a change in size of the deformation zone ahead the crack tip.
 However, the Spb parameter method, for the identification of the crack growth initiation, is correctly applied when plastic behavior is fully achieved [19], [20], so that the plastic component can be assumed to be the predominant component of the deformation shown in Fig.
 4. Additionally, for this comparison it was assumed that the plastic zone has a cylindrical shape along the thickness of the single edge-notched bend specimen, although it is well known that the shape of this zone changes with the transition from plain stress (at the specimen surface) to plain strain conditions (in the central interior portion of the sample) [38]. For comparison purposes, we have analyzed the size of a region with a fixed deformation (4.5% for all the samples).  In the case of neat PP, the size of the region with a deformation smaller or equal to 4.5% is 90 mm3 (Fig.
 4b). The size of this region increases by 35%, up to 123 mm3, in the nanocomposite with 1 wt.
 4c). This increase in size may indicate that a large amount of plastic strain took place in the zone ahead of the crack tip.
 This result seems to be in agreement with those obtained from the flexural characterization; the nanocomposite with 1 wt.
% of GNP has the lowest value of strength and modulus out of neat PP and all our nanocomposites, which may suggest a lower plastic resistance [13]. In the case of the nanocomposite with 5 wt.
 4d), the size of this region decreases by 12% compared to the case of neat PP, with a size of approximately 80 mm3.  A detailed analysis of the fracture surfaces of neat PP and nanocomposites was performed by using scanning electron microscopy.
 As an example, the fracture surface of neat PP and the nanocomposite with 0.5 wt.
 5a and b.
 First, there is a zone characterized by stretched polymeric fibrils (zone 1 in Fig.
 5a–c). Immediately after this first zone, there is a region where voids in the polymer are clearly observable (zone 2 in Fig.
 5). Finally, a third zone with a smooth surface is observed, which is representative of a brittle fracture (zone 3 in Fig.
 5a,b and d).  The first two regions are characteristic of the fracture mechanism of PP known as crazing, which leads to the ductile tearing of the polymer by void nucleation and growth [12], [38], [39]. In neat PP, the voids were nucleated at the intercrystalline regions of the polymer.
 These intercrystalline regions are the weakest points of the material [12], [40]. The fracture surfaces of the neat PP and the nanocomposite with the highest fracture toughness, 1 wt.
 6a and b). By the addition of 1 wt.
 This result seems to indicate that these fibrils have been highly elongated up to failure, which leads to an improvement in fracture toughness due to the consumption of fracture energy [12], [41]. The extensive plastic deformation suffered by the polymer in the region ahead the crack tip can be noted from the DIC analysis, which shows a larger deformation area.
 6d and e, GNP agglomerates have been debonded from the PP matrix can be observed.
 6c, where the fracture surface of the nanocomposite with 5 wt.
 The surface is similar to that of the neat PP but contains GNP agglomerates, which seem to reduce the number of stretched polymeric fibrils; these are shorter and not oriented in the crack-growth direction (compared to the fibrils of the 1 wt.
 The presence of large agglomerates within the polymeric matrix may be responsible for the reduction in deformability, represented by strain at break, of nanocomposites [10], [42], [43]. This result is in good agreement with the results obtained from the DIC analysis, which shows a reduction in the size of the plastic deformation zone for the nanocomposite with 5 wt.
