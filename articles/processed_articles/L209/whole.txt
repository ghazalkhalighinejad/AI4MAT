Glass transition behavior of alumina/polymethylmethacrylate nanocompositesAlumina/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) nanocomposites were synthesized using 39-nm nanoparticles and in situ free-radical polymerization. At filler concentrations greater than 0.5 wt.%, the glass transition temperature, <i>T</i>
                     g, was observed to decrease precipitously by 25 °C compared to the neat polymer. At smaller weight fractions, there were no changes in the composite <i>T</i>
                     g. The abrupt changes seem to indicate a threshold at which a significant volume fraction of polymer has higher mobility that brings about the decrease in <i>T</i>
                     g. Consistent with this behavior, the <i>T</i>
                     g depression was suppressed by coating the nanoparticles to make them compatible with the matrix.['The incorporation of fillers into a polymer matrix can bring about changes in the mechanical and thermal characteristics of the resulting composite.
 One benchmark used to compare the thermal behavior of composites is the glass transition temperature, <i>T</i> g.
 Changes in the <i>T</i> g as a function of the filler content have been reported for polymer composites containing a wide variety of fillers and polymers, but most recently for composites containing nanoscale fillers.
 Most researchers report an increase in the <i>T</i> g as a function of filler content [BIB1 BIB2 BIB3]; however, decreases in the <i>T</i> g have also been reported [BIB1 BIB4].', 'In general, nanofillers are ceramic and therefore do not directly contribute to the <i>T</i> g of the matrix.
 Instead, the interaction of the polymer chains with the surface of the particles can drastically alter the chain kinetics in the region immediately surrounding the particle due to the presence of the interface.
 One of the unique features of nanofillers is their extremely high specific surface area.
 For a well-dispersed system, even low filler volume fractions provide an enormous amount of interfacial area through which the bulk properties of the polymer can be altered [BIB5]. Securing, through adsorption or grafting, the polymer onto a surface restricts molecular mobility of the affected chains, changes the density of packing of polymer chains, and modifies the conformation and orientation of chain segments in the neighborhood of the surface [BIB6]. On the other hand, interfaces characterized by greater mobility are found in freestanding polymer films [BIB7]. In these cases, the less restrictive nature of the free surface can increase the segmental mobility at the air/polymer interface.
 The change from the interfacial to bulk properties takes place in a gradual fashion over a finite distance, the extent of the so-called interface region.
', 'In a previous paper [BIB4], we showed that with the introduction of 5 wt.
% alumina nanoparticles into a polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) matrix, a 600% average increase in strain-to-failure was achieved.
 This dramatic change in mechanical properties was accompanied by a <i>T</i> g depression.
 Further studies of these composites have now yielded new insight into the mechanism leading to the <i>T</i> g depression.

['The PMMA matrix in both the neat PMMA and nanocomposite preparations has a molecular weight of approximately 150,000, average polydispersity of 1.5, and averages 57% syndiotactic as previously reported [BIB4]. The composites exhibit excellent dispersion as shown in the TEM micrograph of [FIG1] . The silane coupling agent, GPS, was determined to be present on the surface of the particles through IR spectroscopy.
', 'The glass transition temperature determined by DSC of the polymer nanocomposite shows a dramatic decrease following the addition of 0.5 wt.
% of 39-nm diameter alumina particles, as shown in [FIG2] . For composites with less than 0.5 wt.
% nanoparticles, the <i>T</i> g is stable, within experimental error, at 119 °C, the <i>T</i> g of the neat PMMA.
 Also shown in [FIG2] is a stable <i>T</i> g for composites with the silane-modified nanoparticles at 5 and 10 wt.
%. The <i>T</i> g values obtained by DMTA (not shown) were, on average, all 7 °C higher than those determined by DSC, but followed the same trends.
