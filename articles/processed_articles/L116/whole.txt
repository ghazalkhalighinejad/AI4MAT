Rubber–clay nanocomposite by solution blending Ethylene vinyl acetate rubber (45% vinyl acetate content, EVA‐45) and organomodified clay (12Me‐MMT) composites were prepared by solution blending of the rubber and the clay. A combination of X‐ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy studies showed that the composites obtained are on the nanometer scale. The measurements of the dynamic mechanical properties for different compositions over a temperature range (−100 to +100°C) showed that the storage moduli of these rubber–clay nanocomposites are higher above the glass to rubber transition temperature compared to the neat rubber. The tensile strength of the nanocomposites is about 1.6 times higher than that of the EVA‐45. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 87: 2216–2220, 2003 [' Recently, studies of inorganic materials with layered structures1-3 and their organic polymer composites4 have attracted great interest because of their unexpected hybrid properties that are synergistically derived from the two components.
4-6 They are finding applications in those areas in which conventional particulate‐filled composites or microcomposites are being used.
 These nanometer level composites show significant improvements in physical, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties5; gas permeability7; and fire retardence.
8 Polymer (nylon 6)–clay nanocomposites were first synthesized by a Toyota group.
5, 9 According to them, the individual layers of clay particles could be completely exfoliated in a continuous polymer matrix that was revealed by X‐ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). There were also unexpected improvements in the mechanical and thermal properties of these nylon 6 nanocomposites containing only 4 wt % montmorillonite (MMT) clay compared with pure nylon 6.10 Most importantly, all these improvements were obtained at very low filler contents.
 One of the most promising strategies for synthesizing nanocomposites involves either intercalation of a suitable monomer and then exfoliating the layered host into their nanoscale elements by subsequent polymerization or polymer intercalation from a solution.
 Liu et al.11 reported the melt intercalation of nylon 6 into octadecylammonium cation‐exchanged sodium MMT.
 Wang et al.12 synthesized rubber–clay nanocomposites by a latex method.
  Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers are typically used for electrical insulation, cable jacketing and repair, component encapsulation and water proofing, corrosion protection, and packaging of components.
13 The available literature reveals that the synthesis and mechanical and dynamic mechanical behavior of nanocomposites derived from EVA (45% VA content, EVA‐45) copolymer and organophilic clay have not yet been reported.
 Ray and Bhowmick recently reported interesting properties of clay–ethylene‐octene copolymer (ENGAGE) rubber nanocomposites.
14 In this report we therefore discuss the nanocomposites having EVA‐45 as the matrix and organophilic clay (12‐Me‐MMT) as the dispersed phase by the solution blending method.
 Figure 1 shows the conceptual picture of the nanocomposites obtained through solution blending.
  The materials have been characterized by XRD, IR, SEM, and TEM.
 The mechanical properties of the virgin EVA‐45 and corresponding 12Me‐MMT composites have also been studied.
 The investigation of the viscoelastic properties plays an important role in characterizing polymer composites.
15, 16 Therefore, EVA and its 12Me‐MMT nanocomposites have been characterized by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). '].
['##IR spectra  Figure 2 displays the IR spectra of Na‐MMT, 12Me‐MMT, EVA‐45, and their nanocomposite containing only 6 wt % 12Me‐MMT.
 The common feature in the IR spectra for Na‐MMT and 12Me‐MMT was the presence of bands at around 3633 (OH free), 3445 (OH hydrogen bond), 1645 (OH bending), 1031 (Si\uf8ffO stretching), and 600–400 cm−1 (Al\uf8ffO stretching).18, 19 The 12Me‐MMT showed the presence of new bands at around 3260 (NHurn:x-wiley:00218995:media:APP11475:tex2gif-stack-1 stretching), 2980 (CH3 asymmetric vibrations of intercalated primary aliphatic ammonium), 2858 (symmetrical CH3 stretching vibration), and 1471 cm−1 (\uf8ffCH2\uf8ff scissor vibration).20 The IR spectra of EVA and its corresponding hybrids with 6 wt % 12Me‐MMT showed the presence of a typical absorption band at around 1740 cm−1 related to the carbonyl of the ester present in EVA.
20 Similar behavior was observed in the case of 2 and 4 wt % hybrids.
 The IR band at around 1635 cm−1 for the CONH2 group corresponding to the solvent (DMAc) was found to be absent in all the samples.
  ##MMT dispersion in rubber matrix  Curves a–g in Figure 3 show the respective XRD patterns of Na‐MMT, 12Me‐MMT, EVA‐45 and 4 wt % Na‐MMT composite, EVA‐45, and the nanocomposites containing 2, 4, and 6 wt % 12Me‐MMT.
 Curves a and b show the presence of a peak at around 2θ = 6.10° and 5.75°, respectively.
 These peaks were assigned to the 001 basal reflection.
 The lattice spacing corresponding to interlayers of Na‐MMT and 12Me‐MMT were calculated and found to be 14.5 and 15.4 Å, respectively.
 We observed that the corresponding basal spacing for 12Me‐MMT in the EVA matrix completely disappeared, thereby suggesting exfoliation of 12Me‐MMT layers in the EVA matrix (i.
 In order to avoid any such possibility, we also performed XRD of EVA with 4 wt % Na‐MMT with a preparative procedure similar to 12Me‐MMT‐EVA composites, which showed a diffraction peak of Na‐MMT in EVA as represented in curve c in Figure 3. Therefore, the conclusion inferred from our XRD of EVA with 2–6 wt % 12Me‐MMT on the formation of delaminated composites of EVA with 12Me‐MMT was further strengthened.
 Figure 4(a) shows the SEM image of a nanocomposite of EVA with 6 wt % 12Me‐MMT.
 Figure 4(b) displays the transmission electron micrograph of the composite of EVA with 6 wt % 12Me‐MMT, which demonstrates that the 2–4 nm sized silicate layers are dispersed homogeneously in the copolymer, EVA matrix.
  ##Mechanical properties  The tensile strength (TS) and elongation at break (EB) were recorded for all the samples shown in Figure 5. The values of the TS, EB, and modulus at 300% are recorded in Table I.
 We observed that the TS of the sample containing 2 wt % 12Me‐MMT is almost constant as compared to the control EVA, but the TS increased by 30 and 55% for 4 and 6 wt % 12Me‐MMT with EVA‐45, respectively.
 It was also noted that the 300% modulus increased with increasing amounts of 12Me‐MMT from 2 to 6 wt %. It may be relevant to mention here that the formation of the delaminated configuration of EVA–clay nanocomposites as mentioned earlier based on XRD, SEM, and TEM maximized the interaction between the clay layers and the polymers.
  ##Dynamic mechanical properties  Figures 6 and 7 show the variation of tan δ and storage modulus, respectively, with the temperature for the pure EVA and EVA–clay nanocomposites.
 The glass to rubber transition temperature decreases with 12Me‐MMT loading to −32°C for the nanocomposite containing 6 wt % 12Me‐MMT.
 Pure EVA showed a sharp peak (β relaxation) at around −27°C as shown in Figure 6. The height of tan δ for β relaxation decreases on increasing the 12Me‐MMT level, probably because of the restricted mobility of the chains due to the presence of organophilic clay layers between the chains of the polymer.
 The EVA–clay nanocomposites exhibited higher storage moduli than the pure EVA above the glass to rubber transition temperature shown in Figure 7. image  '].
