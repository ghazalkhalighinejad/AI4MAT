Dielectric properties of Poly(vinylidene fluoride)/CaCu3Ti4O12 compositesThe possibility of obtaining relatively high dielectric constant polymer–ceramic composite by incorporating the giant dielectric constant material, CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) in a Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) polymer matrix by melt mixing and hot pressing process was demonstrated. The structure, morphology and dielectric properties of the composites were characterized using X-ray diffraction, Thermal analysis, scanning electron microscope, and impedance analyzer. The effective dielectric constant (<i>ε</i>
                     eff) of the composite increased with increase in the volume fraction of CCTO at all the frequencies (100Hz–1MHz) under study. The dielectric loss did not show any variation up to 40% loading of CCTO, but showed an increasing trend beyond 40%. The room temperature dielectric constant as high as 95 at 100Hz has been realized for the composite with 55vol.% of CCTO, which has increased to about 190 at 150°C. Theoretical models like Maxwell’s, Clausius–Mossotti, Effective medium theory, logarithmic law and Yamada were employed to rationalize the dielectric behaviour of the composite and discussed.['Electronic systems in general consist of both the active and passive components.
 The technologies concerning the development of the passive components such as resistors, inductors, and capacitors are steadily growing in the electronic industries.
 Among these passive components, the capacitor is the one which attracts special attention due to its variety of functions that include decoupling, by-passing, filtering and timing capacitors.
 In recent years much work has been done on polymer–ceramic composites.
 Owing to the continuous development towards the miniaturization of electronics, high dielectric constant polymer–ceramic composites have become promising materials for embedded capacitor applications.
', 'Ferroelectric ceramics possessing very high dielectric constants are brittle and suffer from poor mechanical strength.
 On the other hand, polymers having low dielectric constants in the range of 2–5 traditionally used in low leakage capacitors are flexible, easy to process and possess high dielectric strength.
 New composites associated with high dielectric constant, and high dielectric breakdown strength to achieve high volume efficiency and energy storage density for applications of capacitors and electric energy storage devices [bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4] could be fabricated by combining the merits of polymers and ceramics.
 In order to achieve such an objective, high dielectric constant ferroelectric ceramics such as Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3–PbTiO3(PMNPT), Pb(Zr,Ti)O3(PZT) and BaTiO3 (BT) have been used as fillers in polymers by previous workers [bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12]. Dielectric properties of 0–3 composites as a function of the volume fraction of the ceramic were studied by many authors [bib13 bib14 bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18 bib19]. Similarly, metallic fillers were also used to achieve ultra-high dielectric constant in the metal–polymer composites or three-phase composite systems [bib20 bib21 bib22]. Dielectric constants up to 200 were obtained in an irradiated PMNT-P(VDF-TrFE) 0–3 composite [bib7]. The most composite systems studied so far, were confined to ferroelectric ceramic fillers.
', 'The CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) ceramic which has centrosymmetric <i>bcc</i> structure (space group Im3, lattice parameter <i>a</i> ≈7.391Å and <i>Z</i> =2, has gained considerable attention due to its large dielectric constant (<i>ε</i> ∼104–5) which is nearly independent of frequency (up to 10MHz) and low thermal coefficient of permittivity (TCK) over 100–600K temperature range [bib23 bib24]. Several schools of thoughts exist to explain the origin of high dielectric constant observed in CCTO ceramics [bib23 bib25 bib26 bib27 bib28 bib29 bib30 bib31 bib32]. Though several explanations have been put forward, the actual mechanism of the origin of giant dielectric constants in CCTO is still debatable as to whether it is intrinsic or extrinsic in nature.
 Recently, CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) powders have been used as a filler and studied to explore the possibility of obtaining high dielectric constant composites for potential capacitor applications [bib33 bib34 bib35 bib36]. It was reported that, the dielectric constant as high as 740 at 1kHz was achieved for a composition of fixed concentration: 50vol.% CCTO and 50vol.% PVDF-TrFE [bib33]. The dielectric constant increases as the CCTO content increases in the polymer and decreases as the frequency increases [bib34 bib35 bib36]. A three-phase percolative composite with Aluminum powder yielded a high dielectric constant as high as 700 [bib34].', 'In this work we had used PVDF as matrix material because of its better thermal stability, tough and could be easily processed by injection mould/melt process.
 It has non-toxic, resistance to heat and chemicals and low water absorption characteristics which make it more suitable for making electronic components.
 The PVDF-CCTO composite fabricated for the first time by the melt mixing is reported in this work.
 In this article, the details pertaining to the fabrication and characterization of polymer–ceramic composites (PVDF/CCTO) involving CCTO as a filler and PVDF as matrix material are reported.

['[fig1] a–d shows the X-ray powder diffraction patterns obtained for the starting powders (for synthesizing CCTO) calcined at 950°C and 1000°C, for different durations.
 Bragg peaks corresponding to the unreacted phases are noticed in the pattern even after 10h of calcination at 950°C ([fig1]c). Hence the processing temperature has been increased to 1000°C.
 Phase-pure CCTO could be obtained by calcining the powders at 1000°C/10h ([fig1]d). The CCTO crystallites were found to be in the 1–7μm range.
 The X-ray diffraction pattern of the as received PVDF and the hot-pressed composites (PVDF+55vol.% CCTO) are shown in [fig2]  respectively.
 It is evident from these patterns that the PVDF ([fig2]a) exists in mixed phases of α and γ which are non-polar.
 The sharp peaks at 2<i>θ</i> corresponding to 17.7° (100), 18.4° (020), 19.9° (110) and 35.7° (200) are assigned to the α-PVDF [bib6 bib10 bib11]. The broad peak at 2<i>θ</i> =26.8° (022) and 38.7° (211) could be indexed to the γ-phase of PVDF [bib37]. The X-ray diffraction pattern obtained for PVDF+55vol.% CCTO composite ([fig2]b), shows the predominance of CCTO phase.
 This is due to the presence of higher weight percent of CCTO than that of PVDF in the PVDF+55vol.% CCTO composite.
 [fig3]  shows the thermograms recorded for the pure PVDF and the composites.
 It is observed that the pure PVDF is stable up to 390°C and complete degradation of the polymer occurred at around 500°C.
 The composites exhibit ([fig3]b–e) unique decomposition behaviour which is attributed to the presence of CCTO in PVDF.
 The weight loss obtained from the burnt (950°C/24h) out test on a few composite samples by the gravimetric determination is in good agreement with the experimental values.
', 'The SEM micrographs of the hot-pressed as prepared composites containing various volume percent of CCTO filler are shown in [fig4] a–c.
 As reported earlier [bib38], good dispersion along with homogeneous packing of ceramic filler is likely to exhibit high dielectric constant.
 Indeed, we could achieve a dielectric constant as high as 95 at 100Hz eventhough the distribution of the ceramic fillers are heterogeneous for the PVDF with 55vol.% CCTO composite.
 The properties of such phase systems are governed by the number of factors: volume fraction of the dispersing phases, their properties and the way in which these different phases are interconnected [bib1]. The PVDF/ceramic composites are expected to show complex dielectric behaviour due to the different polymorphisms of PVDF.
', '[fig5]  presents the variation of dielectric constant and loss with frequency for the CCTO ceramic sintered at 1100/2h.
 The dielectric constant decreases as the frequency increases and at 10kHz, the dielectric constant and the loss is 2500 and 0.04 respectively.
 The frequency dependence of the dielectric constant of the composite with different CCTO contents are shown in [fig6] . As expected, the effective dielectric constant (<i>ε</i> eff) increases with increase in CCTO content in PVDF at all the frequencies under study.
', 'The frequency dependence of the dielectric loss of PVDF/CCTO composite with different volume percent of CCTO are shown in [fig7] . The loss undergoes two relaxations; one in the low frequency region and the other at high frequencies.
 The relaxation beyond 1MHz is related to the glass transition relaxation of PVDF and is denoted as <i>α</i>a  relaxation [bib39 bib40 bib41]. Similarly, the relaxation peak that appears below 100Hz could be attributed to <i>α</i>a  relaxation associated with molecular motion in the crystalline regions of PVDF [bib41]. It is observed that ([fig7]) the dielectric loss decreases in the 100Hz to ∼10kHz frequency range and then subsequently increases up to a frequency (1MHz) that is covered in the present study.
 There is no appreciable change in the loss behaviour up to the 40% of ceramic loading and then the loss increases especially at low frequencies when the ceramic loading is increased to 55% in the composite which is ascribed to the presence of CCTO particles in PVDF.
 It is believed that up to 40% of ceramic loading, the uniform distribution of CCTO particles (as revealed by the scanning electron microscopy) in the immobile matrix, hinders the formation of networks and results in a decrease in the dielectric loss in the composite.
 However, at higher contents of CCTO, as seen in [fig4]c there is a well established connectivity which resulted in an increase in the dielectric loss.
', '[fig8 fig9]   illustrate the frequency dependence of the dielectric constant and the dielectric loss of PVDF+55vol.% CCTO composite at different temperatures (50–150°C) respectively.
 The dielectric constant increases with increasing temperature ([fig8]). The room temperature dielectric constant is 95 at 100Hz, which has increased to about 190 at 150°C (100Hz). But the rise in dielectric constant with rise in temperature decreases with increase in frequency as shown in [fig8]. There is no significant change in the dielectric constant in the 100kHz–1MHz frequency range even at 150°C.
 These results are consistent with the fact that the dielectric constant of CCTO is nearly independent of frequency (up to 1MHz) and has low thermal coefficient of permittivity (TCK) over a wider range of temperatures (100–600K) [bib27 bib28]. The dielectric loss ([fig9]) also increases as the temperature increases and decreases as the frequency increases which is also consistent with that of the CCTO behaviour.
 [fig10]  shows the room temperature dielectric constant of the composite at 10kHz (experimental) for different volume fractions of CCTO.
 For comparison, the dielectric constant calculated based on various models [bib42 bib43 bib44 bib45 bib46] are also included in the same figure.
 The dielectric property of a diphasic dielectric mixture comprising of spherical crystallites with high dielectric constant dispersed in a matrix of low dielectric constant could be well described by Maxwell’s model [bib42]. According to this model the effective dielectric constant of the composite is given by   (1)  ε  eff =δ   p ε   p   2  /  3  +   ε  c /  3   ε  p+δ   c ε   c δ   p   2  /  3  +   ε  c /  3   ε  p+δ   c where <i>ε</i>c , <i>ε</i>p , <i>δ</i>c  and <i>δ</i>p  are the dielectric constants of CCTO, PVDF, the volume fraction of the dispersoid and the polymer, respectively.
 The values that are substituted for <i>ε</i>c  and <i>ε</i>p  are 2500 and 6.4 (at 10kHz). Here, the predicted value of <i>ε</i> eff deviates much from that of the experimental value for all the volume fractions of CCTO under study.
', 'The most commonly used dielectric mixture rule is Lichtenecker’s [bib43] which is also referred to as the logarithmic mixture rule.
   (2) log   ε  eff =   δ  1 log   ε  1 +   δ  2 log   ε  2', 'This mixture rule is the intermediate form of the series and parallel combination laws for dielectric mixture.
 In the lower volume fraction regime, the experimental results are comparable with those obtained using this model. The <i>ε</i> eff value for <i>f</i> CCTO =0.2, 0.3 is 21.1 and 38.3, which are comparable to the experimental <i>ε</i> eff (24.7 and 42.2). At higher vol.%, predicted value of <i>ε</i> eff deviates much from that of the experimental value ([fig10]).', 'Models like Clausius–Mossotti [bib44] and Effective Medium theory [bib45] were also used for predicting the effective dielectric constant.
 In the Clausius–Mossotti treatment of a mixture of dielectrics composed of spherical crystallite dispersed in a continuous medium, the effective dielectric constant (<i>ɛ</i> eff) of the composite is calculated using the equation:   (3)  ε  eff =   ε  p 1   +   3  δ c(   ε  c -   ε  p ) ε  c +  2   ε  p', 'Since CCTO particles that are dispersed in the matrix are non-spherical in nature as evidenced by SEM, the predicted value of ɛeff does not fit into the model and is at variance with that of the experimental value ([fig10]).', 'The effective medium theory (EMT) model [bib45] has been established taking into account the morphology of the particles.
 According to which the effective dielectric constant is given by   (4)  ε  eff =   ε  p 1   + f   c  (ε   c  -ε   p  )ε   p  + n ( 1 -f   c  ) (ε   c  -ε   p  )where <i>f</i>c , is the volume fraction of the ceramic dispersed, <i>ɛ</i>c , <i>ɛ</i>p  and <i>n</i> are the dielectric constants of the particle, polymer and the ceramic morphology fitting factor respectively.
 In the low volume fraction regime, the <i>ε</i> eff value for <i>f</i> CCTO =0.2 is 20.4, which is comparable to the experimental <i>ε</i> eff (24.7). The ceramic particle size has been proven to influence the effective dielectric constant in the composite and the size of the CCTO particle used in this work is around 1–7μm range.
 Though this model is suitable for the ceramic particles less than 1μm and also depends on their morphology, interestingly, the experimental value fits well into the EMT model [bib45] with the shape parameter <i>n</i> =0.11. The difference between the experimental data and the predicted value is less than 10% in the higher volume fraction regime (up to 55vol.%) ([fig10]). It is to be noted that the morphology fitting factor obtained from the fit (<i>n</i> =0.11) is closer to that of reported (<i>n</i> =0.13) [bib45]. The theoretical morphology fitting factor is closer to that of the experimental one, and is consistent with that observed (irregular shaped particles) in the present studies ([fig4]a–c) [bib45]. Therefore, the close agreement that is found between the experimental and theoretical values is attributed to the morphology of the dispersed particles.
', 'The model that was developed by Yamada et al. [bib46], is used to predict <i>ε</i> eff.
 According to which:   (5)  ε  eff =   ε  1 1   +  nf   CCTO  (ε   2  -ε   1  ) nε   1  + (ε   2  -ε   1  ) ( 1 -f   CCTO  )Here <i>ε</i> 1 and <i>ε</i> 2 are, respectively, the dielectric constant of the epoxy and CCTO ceramics, “<i>n</i>” is the parameter related to the geometry of the ceramic particles and ƒCCTO is the volume fraction of the CCTO phase in the matrix.
 [fd1] to the observed values.
 Here, in the higher volume fraction regime, the experimental results are comparable to those obtained using this model, when the parameter “<i>n</i>” is around 9.3 ([fig10]). The <i>ε</i> eff value for <i>f</i> CCTO =0.4 is 43.7 which is comparable to the experimental <i>ε</i> eff (48.2). Similarly, the <i>ε</i> eff value for <i>f</i> CCTO =0.55 is 74 which is comparable to the experimental <i>ε</i> eff (69.4). Here again, it is observed that the “<i>n</i>” parameter is related to the geometry of the particles, and the “<i>n</i>” parameter of 9.3 obtained from the fit is correlated to the irregular geometry of the ceramic particles as mentioned above.
', 'The effective dielectric constant of polymer/filler composite material is dependent not only on the dielectric constants of the polymer and the filler, size and shape of the filler and the volume fraction of the filler, but also on the dielectric constant of the interphase region, volume of the interphase region and on the type of coupling agents [bib47 bib48 bib49 bib50]. One cannot afford to ignore these aspects for fabricating composites with improved dielectric properties.
