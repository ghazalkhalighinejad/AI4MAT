Measurement of the critical aspect ratio and interfacial shear strength in MWNT/polymer compositesThis paper presents a bulk composite method for determining the critical aspect ratio and relative interfacial shear stress (ISS) for multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT)/polymer composites. Through a modified pullout test and fragmentation test, it was found that the critical aspect ratio was 300 and decreased by a factor of 3 due to surface modification, and that MWNTs at an angle of greater than 60° to the loading direction failed in bending instead of pulling out of the matrix. Finite element analysis was used to determine the critical bending shear strength and MWNT modulus. The obtained bending shear strength was used in a mechanics model developed to provide bounds for the ISS in the experimental composite system. The calculated ISS for as-received nanotube falls between 4.8 and 13.7MPa, and for surface treated nanotube falls in the range of 11.1 and 38.3MPa. These values are consistent with the ISS reported for carbon fiber/polymer composites and also show that the ISS almost triples due to chemical modification of the MWNT surface.['In order to optimize the properties of carbon multiwalled nanotube (MWNT)/polymer composites, key micromechanical parameters, such as the nanotube/polymer interfacial shear stress (ISS) and load transfer length (or load transfer aspect ratio), must be quantified.
 Because these parameters are not well known in nanotube composites, it is difficult to compare measured mechanical properties to predicted values [bib1 bib2] particularly for short fiber composite models.
 In micron scale composites where the ISS and load transfer length can be directly measured, these quantities can be more reliably predicted [bib3 bib4]. For example, the lower than expected Young’s modulus observed in MWNT/polymer composites is often attributed to poor dispersion [bib5 bib6 bib7] or nanotube waviness [bib8]. In addition, however, MWNTs with an aspect ratio near or below the aspect ratio required for complete load transfer can also be the cause of low Young’s modulus.
 [fig1]  shows a typical result from the Kelly–Tyson model in which load is transferred from the lower modulus matrix to the higher modulus fiber via a constant interfacial shear stress [bib9], perhaps due to plastic deformation at the interface or do to frictional load transfer.
 We use a simplified model such as Kelly–Tyson because the shape of the stress transfer function is unknown in these systems, and for the purposes of this paper, assuming a constant ISS is useful. If the strain is increased in the composite until the resulting fiber stress is larger than the failure stress, the fiber fractures ([fig1]a). If the aspect ratio (AR) of the fibers is too low (either as-grown or due to fracture during processing), then the equistrain condition is not met, and the fibers do not carry the maximum load ([fig1]c). Therefore, if the AR of the MWNT is too low, the Young’s modulus of the composite is reduced.
', 'The load transfer aspect ratio changes as a function of applied strain ([fig1]a). In this paper, we determine the critical aspect ratio (ARc), which is defined as in [fig1]b and is a function both of the strength of the fiber and the fiber/matrix ISS.
 For purposes of discussion, if a constant ISS is assumed, then the ARc can be calculated as [bib10](1)   L   c  r  =σf  τave  where <i>τ</i>ave  is the average ISS, <i>σ</i>f  is the strength of the fiber, (<i>L</i>c /<i>r</i>, critical fiber length/radius) is the ARc.
 If the ARc is measured, an average ISS can be calculated.
', 'In order to measure ISS, and ARc, several micromechanical tests have been developed.
 In the fiber fragmentation test, a fiber of length, <i>L</i>, is placed in a composite and as the composite is loaded, the load in the fiber exceeds the fracture strength and fails.
 The aspect ratio at which the fiber is just long enough to reach an equistrain condition ([fig1]b), and thus reach the critical fiber failure stress, is the ARc.
 The ISS can then be calculated from the ARc with varying levels of complexity [bib11 bib12 bib13 bib14 bib15]. In addition, knowing the ARc is important for: (1) understanding fracture behavior because longer fibers can lead to improved damage resistance through crack bridging and (2) predicting the modulus of short fiber (or nanotube) composites [bib4 bib16 bib17].', 'A second test, the pullout test, uses the same principle as the fiber fragmentation test, but a fiber is embedded in a matrix, and the force to pullout the fiber is measured.
 The pullout force, <i>F</i>pullout , as a function of embedded length can be used to calculate the ISS as [bib9](2)  τ  ave  pullout =Fpullout 2π rLpullout', 'In addition, if the embedded aspect ratio is longer than the ARc, the fiber will break, and the pull-out aspect ratio will be the ARc.
', 'Pioneering experiments by Wagner’s group [bib18 bib19 bib20] used nanoscale versions of these traditional micromechanical tests to measure the ISS in nanotube composites.
 Their results show direct evidence of increases in ISS due to surface modification of MWNT.
 Both pullout energies and interfacial shear strengths were measured from the pullout test.
', 'The challenge in using the current nanoscale methods is that it is difficult to obtain the statistics necessary to fully characterize the interfacial behavior due to the complexity of the tests.
 The ARc is actually a distribution of values, and thus statistics are required.
 In this paper, using a bulk composite approach, the ARc and relative values of the ISS were measured as a function of interface modification.
 Additionally, using an analytical approach, the bounds for the ISS were calculated.

[['Dispersion', ['[fig4]a and b show low magnification FESEM images of the fracture edge of the ARNT/PC and EPNT/PC composites, respectively at 5wt.
']], ['MWNT fracture', ['[fig5]a shows a comparison of aspect ratios of the nanotubes within the grip section in the ARNT/PC and EPNT/PC composites dissolved in THF.
 The MWNTs were grown to an initial aspect ratio of approximately 32000. However, in the grip section the nanotubes have an average aspect ratio of 1926.6 and 708 for ARNT/PC and EPNT/PC samples, respectively.
 [fig5] also shows, however, that in the fracture region there is a further significant decrease in the aspect ratio range with average aspect ratios of 349.3 and 86.4 for ARNT/PC and EPNT/PC, respectively.
', 'Given that the nanotube pullout lengths are due to failure during loading and are not different due to differences in the initial lengths, the pull-out aspect ratio and pullout angle were measured from TEM slices as indicated in [fig3]. The pullout angle is defined as the angle with respect to the loading direction ([fig3]). The results are shown in [fig6]. Three aspects of [fig6] are to be noted.
 Second, above approximately 60°, most of the nanotubes failed at the fracture surface, and did not pullout.
 This is seen by the lack of data above about 60°. It is likely that the failure mode was due to the bending load on the MWNT, as discussed further below.
', 'Due to the 50nm thicknesses of the TEM slices, some of the tubes are artificially shortened, leading to very low apparent aspect ratios with averages of 12.6 and 4.61 for the ARNT and EPNT respectively.
 However, the data show that although pullout occurred at angles below 60°, the pullout length was not a function of pullout angle.
 This implies that instead of relying on the TEM data, which may have artifacts, that we can use FESEM images to quantify the full pull-out aspect ratios ([fig3]c). A quantitative comparison between [fig6 fig7] shows that the distribution of aspect ratios between the ARNT and EPNT are similar for the two techniques even though the absolute values are different: treated tubes have a narrower distribution and a shorter average pull-out aspect ratio while untreated tubes have a broader distribution and a larger average pull-out aspect ratio.
 Thus, the ARc measured via pullout (both from TEM and FESEM), and via essentially a fragmentation test (using the data from [fig4]b) were recorded.
 While the latter numbers will be impacted by those nanotubes that failed in bending at angles greater than 60°, this is a small population of the fibers ([fig6]).', 'To use the ARc to calculate a simple average ISS using Eq.
 [fd1], the nanotube strength must be known.
 Fortunately, Barber performed strength calculations using an AFM pullout test on MWNT produced using a CVD growth method and the same trans-esterification surface modification procedure as used in this study [bib27 bib28]. It was found that the pullout force at which the MWNT started to fail was the same for the treated and surface modified MWNT, and if there was a difference, the strength of the surface treated MWNT was higher than that of the untreated tubes.
 Using the force at failure from Barber’s paper [bib20] for very similar MWNT, a nominal MWNT strength of 2.5±1.5GPa was determined.
', '[tbl1] compares ARc and the calculated average ISS (Eq.
 [fd1]) of ARNT and EPNT composites measured after dissolution of the matrix (essentially traditional fragmentation test), from microtomed slices of the fracture edge using TEM, and from FESEM of the fracture edge.
 Please note the aspect ratios in [tbl1] from the experimental measurements are relative measures only, except for the first method.
 Note that in [tbl1] the average ratio of the ISS for untreated and surface modified MWNT among all three techniques is around 1:3. This result is in strong agreement with studies where chemical surface modification has been shown to improve the interfacial bonding between matrix and nanotubes and hence the ISS of nanotube-filled composites [bib1 bib20 bib25 bib26 bib32]. It also indicates that while the absolute values of the pullout length from each of the techniques varies, to find relative changes due to surface modification, they are all useful.']]].
