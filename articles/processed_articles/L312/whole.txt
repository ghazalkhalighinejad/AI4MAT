Improving mechanical and thermal properties of TiO2-epoxy nanocompositeTiO2-epoxy nanocomposites were fabricated by using an innovative ultrasonic dual mixing process (UDM) process consists of ultrasonic mixing with simultaneous impeller stirring. TiO2 nanoparticles were used as reinforcement in epoxy resin with weight percentages 5, 10 and 15 respectively. Mechanical properties of each group of composite material were identified using tensile and dynamic mechanical measurements. The effect of TiO2 nanoparticles addition on dynamical mechanical properties of epoxy matrix in the terms of storage modulus and tanδ value with respect to the temperature at a dynamic heating rate of 2 °C/min were studied. The dispersion condition of TiO2 content in epoxy matrix has been thoroughly investigated by using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis. Tensile tests and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed on each group of TiO2-epoxy composite to determine their tensile strength, toughness and thermal stability.['The thermoset epoxy based polymer resins are the widely used materials in adhesive, automobile industry, structural polymer composites, high performance adhesive joints, paints manufacturing, high performance tough coating and other engineering applications [bib1 bib2 bib3]. Epoxy resins are distinguished due to their excellent thermal and mechanical properties, high corrosion and chemical resistance, low shrinkage on curing and the ability to be processed under a variety of conditions [bib4]. Fully cured epoxy resins form highly crosslinked, three-dimensional networks.
 However, the high level of crosslinking in epoxy networks leads to inherent brittle materials and that constraint many of its properties and applications [bib5]. Several research works have been carried out to enhance the thermal and mechanical properties of epoxy resin aligned with the use of different type of nanofillers reinforcement.
', 'Among the most investigated metal-oxide, the TiO2 is probably the most interesting because of the combination of its unique properties such as non-toxicity, chemical, corrosion and photo stability, good electrical properties, good compatibility with various materials, high photocatalytic activity, high refractive index and ability to absorb ultraviolet (UV) light [bib6 bib7 bib8] Due to these excellent properties, TiO2 nanoparticles have been used to transfer their excellent properties into coatings, in skin care products, in nano medicine, in lithium-ion batteries, in food packaging, in solar cells, in water purification, in gas sensors and in polymer matrix etc.
 The TiO2 nanoparticles have been successfully reinforced in to epoxy [bib9], polyethylene [bib10], polypropylene [bib11], poly(methyl methacrylate) [bib12 bib13], poly(vinyl butyral) [bib14] and poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) [bib15 bib16] to improve the mechanical performance.
 TiO2 nanoparticle has also been used to improve photosensitive property of polyaniline (PANI) [bib17] and photocatalytic degradability of polyacrylamide (PAM) [bib18]. The essential challenge in the manufacturing process of polymer nanocomposite is obtaining a homogeneous and cluster free dispersion of nanofillers in polymer matrix, which provides a unique set of enhanced properties at low filler loading [bib19].', 'Therefore, to accomplish most favorable upgrading of properties, the different strategies have been attempted, for example: melt processing [bib20 bib21], chemical modification of the nanoparticle surface [bib22 bib23]; chemical modification of the polymer matrix generating specific functional groups [bib24]; in situ polymerization and sol–gel methods [bib25]. Mostly the ultrasonic mixing process [bib26 bib27] has been conveniently employed for dispersion of nano reinforcement in polymer matrix to improve the performance of nanocomposites.
 But, in spite of its highly popular use with full efficiency, often the ability of this process remains deficient to elimination the cluster size of nanoparticles.
 Some researchers used high energy ball milling process (HEBM) for dispersion of nanoparticles in polymer matrix [bib28].', 'The major problem for preparation of polymer based nanofiller composite by simple ultrasonic mixing is the large cluster size variation in whole matrix and its distribution.
 In ultrasonic mixing process, the ultrasonic vibration is more effective near probe region and less effective to the region far from probe and also the possibility to degrade the material near probe region due to high intensity vibration.
 Dispersion of nanofillers in epoxy matrix and properties of nanofiller-epoxy composites prepared by recently developed ultrasonic dual mixing (UDM), ultrasonic mixing with simultaneous stirring [bib29 bib30 bib31 bib32 bib33] found superior to the composites prepared by other techniques.
 The UDM process is capable to break particle cluster size and its homogeneous distribution of nanoparticle in whole epoxy matrix.
 In UDM process the slurry of polymer composite mixture in rotating motion and ultrasonic vibration affect the whole solution equally and also homogenize the temperature in whole matrix to reduce the degradation.
 The different types and amount of inorganic nanoparticles such as Al2O3  [bib29], SiO2  [bib30], TiO2  [bib31], ZrO2  [bib32], MWCNTs [bib33] and graphene [bib34] have been tried to disperse in semi-viscous matrix by ultrasonic dual mixing (UDM) technique defined as ultrasonic vibration, along with mechanical stirring.
 UDM process effectively breaks cluster and distribute nanoparticles in a semi-viscous epoxy base resin in order to produce a more homogeneous nanofiller polymer composite.
 Nanofiller composites prepared by UDM have shown considerable enhancement of conductivity, physical and mechanical properties, especially the toughness of the base epoxy matrix without sacrificing other properties.
', 'In the current study, an attempt has been made to produce homogeneously dispersed TiO2-epoxy composite via ultrasonic dual mixing (UDM) process in the presence of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) solvent.
 The solvent has been used to avoid deterioration of the epoxy resin properties by homogenization of the temperature rise in the vicinity of ultrasonic horn throughout the slurry of epoxy resin.
 The influence of TiO2 nanoparticle content loading and their dispersion condition on mechanical and thermal properties of epoxy resin has been studied.

[['Morphology of TiO2 nanoparticles', ['The size of nanoparticles has been verified under TEM and they are found to lie in the range of 30–40\xa0nm with approximately round in shape as shown in [fig2](a). [fig2](b) shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, which reveals that the TiO2 nanoparticles are in polycrystalline in nature.
']], ['Tensile properties', ['The effect of TiO2 (10\xa0wt.
%) content on the tensile strength of the nanocomposite processed at different power amplitudes 50, 60 and 70% of the ultrasonic dual mixing has been shown in [fig3]. The figure shows that the tensile strength of the epoxy nanocomposite increased with amplitude up to 60% and decreased at 70%. The TiO2 (10\xa0wt.
%)-epoxy nanocomposite processed at 60% power amplitude of the UDM showed maximum enhancement in tensile strength of about 22% compared to neat epoxy adhesive.
 UDM processing at 70% amplitude decreased tensile strength of composite may have caused degradation of epoxy matrix.
 The use at amplitude of 70% causes degradation of epoxy matrix due to high heat generation especially in the region near the ultrasonic horn, which reduces strength and toughness of the composite.
', 'The typical stress–strain curves of UDM processed TiO2 reinforced epoxy nanocomposites are shown in [fig4]. Effect of TiO2 nanoparticle loading contents (5, 10 and 15\xa0wt.

% nanoparticle reinforced epoxy matrix processed by UDM gives maximum enhancement of tensile strength of about 22% and toughness about 69% compared to that of the unprocessed epoxy resin.
 Area under stress-strain curve was evaluated within the zone extended up to a vertical line drawn from the fracture point of the plot to the x-axis ([fig5]). The mathematical area within this zone was evaluated by using origin software analysis.
 Epoxy based nanocomposite containing 10\xa0wt.
% TiO2 nanoparticles has considerably enhanced the strength and toughness of matrix compared as neat and (5 and 15\xa0wt.
%) TiO2. This may have primarily happened because size and distribution of nanoparticles cause well bonded contact between the nanoparticles and epoxy matrix resulting in significant increase of tensile properties.
', 'The tensile strength of the epoxy composite materials prepared by simple ultrasonic mixing (UM) was also identified with same TiO2 content used for UDM.
 Tensile strength of composite materials prepared by using both UDM and UM process has been shown in [fig6]. In this figure we can clearly see that the strength of nanocomposites prepared by UDM gives better enhancement as compared to UM.
']], ['FESEM studies', ["The FESEM images of TiO2-epoxy nanocomposite containing varying amounts of nanoparticle obtained by the processing route of UDM are shown in [fig7]. The general tendency of clustering of nanoparticles restricting their uniform dispersion in epoxy resin is primarily caused by the Van Der Waal's force amongst the particles and viscosity of the resin.
 The FESEM images show that the size of TiO2 nanoparticles cluster lies in nano scale range of 30–65, 30–66 and 65–130\xa0nm varying with the increase of TiO2 content in the matrix as 5, 10 and 15\xa0wt.
 The FESEM images of different amount of TiO2 (5, 10 and 15\xa0wt.
%) nanoparticles content in the epoxy matrix is very much in agreement to the discussions given above in explaining the cause of its variation in tensile properties of TiO2-epoxy nanocomposites.
", 'The FESEM image of TiO2 (10\xa0wt.

%)-epoxy nanocomposite has been shown in [fig9]. In this figure we can see that the change in morphology of fracture surface due to the particle reinforcement to be a possible reason of increased toughening effect.
']], ['Dynamic mechanical analysis', ['The strong inﬂuence of TiO2 nanoparticle content on epoxy matrix was also observed in the dynamic mechanical properties.
 [fig10] shows the variation of the dynamic measurements of storage modulus as a function of temperature for the neat and TiO2-epoxy nanocomposites.
 The storage modulus of epoxy matrix increased with addition of TiO2 content up to 10\xa0wt.
% and decreased at 15\xa0wt.
%. The drop in storage modulus indicates the increase in ﬂexibility of the system at higher loading TiO2 (15\xa0wt.
 The decrease of storage modulus at higher TiO2 contents can be interpreted by an increasing susceptibility of agglomeration, leading to less energy dissipation in the system under viscoelastic deformation [bib35]. It seems that with the increase in density and agglomerates size ([fig7]d), the molecular motion and movement of chains become easier, leading to a decrease in storage modulus values.
 The storage modulus in the glassy regions showed maximum enhancement of about 29% at 40\xa0°C for TiO2 (10\xa0wt.
 Below rubbery region, the storage modulus of TiO2-epoxy nanocomposites shows strong shift due to the enhancement of interaction between nanoparticles-polymer chains and reduction of polymer chain mobility in epoxy matrix against nanoparticles incorporation.
 The cluster free and homogeneous dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles in epoxy matrix must dispel energy due to resistance against viscoelastic deformation of the surrounding matrix.
 However, it has been identified that only a slight influence was observed in elastic properties in rubbery region with addition of nanoparticles content in epoxy matrix that is rationalized as due to the comparatively higher amplitude of molecular motion in this region [bib36].', 'Damping properties of TiO2-epoxy nanocomposites materials has been defined by the ratio of energy dissipated (loss modulus) to energy stored (storage modulus) and is measure in term of loss factor or tanδ value ([fig11]). It may be further accomplished that the nano cluster size and homogeneous dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles in epoxy matrix would support in dissipating energy under viscoelastic deformation [bib37 bib38]. The temperature range with tanδ\xa0>\xa00.3 is taken as a standard to evaluate the damping property of materials [bib39]. The temperature range with tanδ\xa0>\xa00.3 for the neat epoxy was found to be 174.6–193.8\xa0°C and corresponding tanδ peak was 0.56 and for the epoxy sample containing TiO2 5, 10 and 15\xa0wt.
%, the range was 177.4–197.1\xa0°C, 182.4–202.8\xa0°C and 169.4–189.0\xa0°C with corresponding peak 0.55, 0.57 and 0.49 respectively ([fig11]). The best damping property in the terms of tanδ values has been found for the 10\xa0wt.
% TiO2 loaded epoxy system and further addition of TiO2 nanoparticle contain 15\xa0wt.
 Improvement in tanδ values results can be credited to the increased internal friction in the TiO2-epoxy nanocomposites and is a measure of dissipating energy.
 Nanolevel cluster size and homogeneous dispersion of TiO2 nanoparticles into the epoxy matrix provides additional internal friction between TiO2-polymer interfaces and it could be responsible for the increment in damping properties of composite [bib40 bib41 bib42].']], ['Thermal characteristics', ['The characteristic plots of thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to study the thermal stability of the neat and composite epoxy ([fig12]). The TGA thermograms show that the thermal stability of epoxy matrix steadily increases signiﬁcantly with the increase of TiO2 nanoparticle loading up to 10\xa0wt.
% and followed by an appreciable decrease in it with further loading of particles 15\xa0wt.
 The weight loss was measured between 150 and 700\xa0°C.
 This is because the variation of weight might be additionally affected by water absorption and appreciable oxidation at temperatures below 150\xa0°C and above 700\xa0°C respectively [bib43]. It is observed that thermal stability of TiO2-epoxy nanocomposite significantly increases with respect to that of the neat epoxy by the increase of TiO2 content from 5 to 10\xa0wt.
', 'As the initial 25% weight loss of thermosetting polymers is crucial to understand their thermal stability, therefore a trend of decomposition temperature for different fraction of weight loss percentage has been studied from the TGA thermograms of the neat and nanocomposite epoxy as illustrated in [tbl1]. It is observed that the 50% weight loss of the neat epoxy takes place at a temperature of 381\xa0°C.
 However, in case of the nanocomposite epoxy, the decomposition temperature at 50% weight loss increases with TiO2 particle loading up to 10\xa0wt.
% about 393\xa0°C followed by a decrease in it with further loading of particle.
 The decomposition temperature of TiO2 (15\xa0wt.
%)-epoxy nanocomposite is slightly lower than the TiO2 (10\xa0wt.
%)-epoxy composite ([tbl1]). It may be attributed to the nonhomogeneous dispersion of clustered nanoparticles in the epoxy matrix for such high level of particle loading leads to the ﬂuctuations in results.
 Thus, it can be clearly inferred that for 75% weight loss of the neat epoxy, the presence of TiO2 (10\xa0wt.
%) nanoparticles signiﬁcantly enhance its stability from 401\xa0°C to 435\xa0°C.
 In general, the thermosetting polymers have relatively large cross-linking density, resulting in relatively high decomposition temperature [bib31]. Formation of large clusters may adversely inﬂuence the extent of particle-matrix binding and thus reduce their thermal stability due to inappropriate mixing especially at higher loading of nanoparticles beyond a critical level (i.
