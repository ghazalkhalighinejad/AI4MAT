Dielectric Integrity of Silica-PAI Nanocomposites at Elevated TemperatureIt has been shown that in many cases, the addition of nanoscale metal oxide fillers to polymers leads to an improvement in dielectric breakdown strength at room temperature. However, in some cases electrical insulation is exposed to elevated temperatures. A thermally stable polymer material, such as polyamideimide (PAI), is desired for these applications. For this reason, breakdown strength measured at elevated temperatures is required, since this property is expected to degrade with an increase in temperature. The addition of nanoparticles has been shown to increase PAI decomposition temperature and is also expected to mitigate the effect of increased temperature on dielectric properties. In this paper, AC and DC breakdown strength of PAI and nanosilica filled PAI are reported at room temperature and elevated temperatures. (200-340°C) Test temperatures were well below the decomposition range of polyamideimide as measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Silica composites at all loadings (whether treated or untreated) were shown to have a higher AC and DC breakdown strength at elevated temperatures than unfilled material. Dielectric spectroscopy results are also presented. ['It is well known that the addition of nanoparticles can increase the breakdown strength of a polymer [1]. Dielectric behavior at elevated temperatures, however, has not been widely investigated and it is important to understand for applications in which the insulation will be exposed to severe temperatures, either permanently or intermittently.
 Polyamideimide (PAI) is a good candidate for use at high temperature because of its high thermal stability.
 (It degrades at temperatures above 500°C, as measured previously [2]. In comparison, polyimide degradation temperature is in the range of 400-500°C [3].) '].
