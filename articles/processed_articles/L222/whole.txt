Investigation of the dispersion process of SWNTs/SC-15 epoxy resin nanocompositesDue to their exceptional mechanical and functional properties, carbon nanotubes are considered by many researchers as one of the most promising reinforcement for the next generation of high-performance nanocomposites. Currently, nanotube dispersion is the most critical issue for developing high-performance carbon nanotube-reinforced composites. In this research, considerable improvements of the nanotube dispersion in single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)/SC-15 epoxy resin nanocomposites were obtained through the use of tip sonication and the addition of acetone. Using different dispersion formulations and processing parameters, several nanocomposites samples containing 0.5wt.% nanotubes were fabricated. Significant improvements in the mechanical properties of the resulting nanocomposites were illustrated by a 50.8% increase in the storage modulus. The significant improvements of nanotube dispersion and mechanical performance were attributed to the combined use of tip sonication and acetone as dispersion aids during sample processing.['Since carbon nanotubes were first discovered in 1990 [bib1], many researchers have been striving to learn more about their remarkable mechanical and physical properties.
 Nanotubes exist in the form of multi-walled nanotubes (MWNT), which were discovered by Iijima [bib1], and single-walled nanotubes (SWNT), which were discovered by Bethune et al. in 1993 [bib2]. Because SWNTs have far better mechanical properties than MWNTs, many researchers are trying to use SWNTs as reinforcement materials to fabricate high-performance nanocomposites.
', "SWNTs have outstanding mechanical properties, which exceed any existing reinforcement materials.
 SWNTs have a high aspect ratio [bib3], possess extremely high Young's modulus (greater than 1 TPa), and demonstrate exceptional strength (∼100 times stronger than steel). Furthermore, SWNTs demonstrate superior thermal conductivity (about twice as high as diamond), good electrical capacity (1000 times higher than copper), and excellent stiffness and flexibility [bib4]. Their thermal stability is as high as 2800°C in vacuum.
 In light of these exceptional properties, carbon nanotubes are expected to be used as the reinforcement and functional materials for applications in a variety of fields, such as high-performance composites, biological and chemical sensors, magnetic recording, nanoelectronic devices, tips for scanning probe microscopy and flat panel displays [bib5 bib6 bib7].", 'In practice, however, many reports indicate that nanotube/epoxy composites are weaker or only slightly stronger than the neat epoxy resin [bib8]. This has been found to be primarily due to a combination of several factors, namely poor SWNT dispersion, inadequate alignment and weak interfacial bonding.
 As a result, these factors have become fundamental issues for developing high-performance nanocomposites.
', 'One of the most important parameters in fabricating carbon nanotube composites is tube dispersion in the matrix.
 Nanotube dispersion is indeed critical to reinforcing efficiency because the relative ease of nanotube to nanotube sliding when they are assembled in ropes significantly affects the mechanical properties of the resulting material. Tube aggregation and large resin-rich area due to poor tube dispersion are also harmful to mechanical properties of the resultant nanocomposites.
 As a result, a major goal of improving nanotube composites processing techniques is to prevent the nanotubes from aggregating together and forming large nanotube ropes in the matrix.
 Current methods of improvements include sonication, high shear mixing, surfactant addition, chemical modification through nanotube functionalization, wrapping the nanotubes with polymer chains or combinations of these methods [bib9].', 'In this research, several experiments were conducted in order to investigate the factors that could influence the nanotube dispersion in an epoxy resin matrix, thus affecting the mechanical properties of the resulting nanocomposites.
 The nanotube dispersion and mechanical properties of the SWNT-reinforced epoxy resin matrix composites were investigated through scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA).'].
[['DMA analysis', ['Improved mechanical properties and nanotube dispersion of the SWNT/SC-15 nanocomposites were confirmed by the DMA and SEM analyses.
 [fig1](a) and (b) show the DMA results of the neat resin and all six nanocomposite samples.
 A detailed summary of the storage modulus and <i>T</i>gs of the samples is also shown in [tbl3].', ['Tip sonication', ['As compared to the SC-15 neat resin sample, Samples 2, 3, 5 and 6 showed a 32.7, 50.84, 11.80 and 15.09% improvement in their respective storage moduli.
 The ultrasonicator used in the research is Sonicator 3000 machine from Misonix.
 This machine has a generator with a 600W output, a 20KHz convector and temperature control. A titanium tapped horn with a 1/2″ (12.7mm) diameter tip is connected with the convector.
 In contrast, the storage moduli of Samples 1 and 4, which did not undergo tip sonication, decreased by 1.9 and 15.29%, respectively.
']], ['Bath sonication', ['The manufacturing procedure for fabricating Samples 2, 4 and 6 involved using an L&R bath sonicator.
 The results showed that the storage moduli of Samples 2 and 6 increased but that of Sample 4 decreased.
']], ['Bath sonication/tip sonication interaction', ['Both Samples 2 and 6, however, with extra sonication time (6h tip and 6h bath sonication) showed greater increase in properties, which indicates that long sonication effectively disperses the nanotubes.
 It is a possible source of the explanation for the storage moduli of Samples 2 and 6, not increasing as much as that of Sample 3.']], ['Surfactant', ['The manufacturing formulation of Samples 1, 4, 5 and 6 included the use of surfactant (BYK-9076). The results showed that the storage moduli of Samples 1 and 4 decreased, but Sample 5 has limited increase as compared to the samples without adding the surfactant.
']], ['Acetone', ['During the manufacturing of Samples 1, 3 and 6, acetone was used to dilute the mixture and reduce the viscosity.
 The results showed that the storage modulus of Sample 1 decreased because of lack of sonication, but both Samples 3 and 6 had visible increase.
 Also, the highest mechanical properties were seen in Sample 3. Sample 3 was fabricated by using tip sonication and acetone addition as processing aids, which further indicates that the combination of tip sonication and acetone results in improved nanotube dispersion.
', 'The <i>T</i>   g measurements reveal that all samples containing nanotubes have a lower <i>T</i>   g value than that of the neat resin, except for Sample 2. Sample 2 was the only sample fabricated without adding surfactant or solvent and its <i>T</i>   g is 104.21°C, which is nearly 7°C higher than that of the neat resin sample.
 However, all other nanocomposite samples manufactured with adding either surfactant or acetone exhibited that their <i>T</i>   gs are 7–23°C lower than that of the neat resin sample.
 The result showed that the <i>T</i>   g of the neat resin sample with added acetone during mixture is about 20°C lower than that of the neat resin sample (shown in [tbl3]), produced without adding any acetone.
', 'In summary, due to the low viscosity of the SC-15 resin, using tip sonication and acetone provides a more effective method to disperse nanotubes in the SC-15 resin.
 A significant increase in the storage modulus, as high as 50.8% for 0.5wt.
']]]], ['Observation of nanotube dispersion', ['Since the DMA results of Sample 3 showed the best mechanical performance, an SEM analysis was further conducted to investigate nanotube dispersion.
 The SEM images showed the fracture surface of the SC-15 neat resin ([fig2](a)) and the fracture surface of Sample 3 ([fig2](b) and (c)). Many small dots can be seen, scattered across the surface of the neat resin and across the surface of Sample 3. The SC-15 epoxy is similar to a second-phase rubber-toughened epoxy.
 These dots were caused by the toughening rubber particles at the fracture surface [bib10].', 'The fracture surface of the SC-15 neat resin sample ([fig2] (a)) was relatively smooth.
', 'As compared to the SEM images of the neat resin sample, the images of the SWNT/SC-15 nanocomposite sample ([fig2] (b) and (c)) showed that the embedded nanotubes significantly modified the morphology of the fracture surface.
 This would be due to the presence of large quantity of nanotubes [bib11]. More curved patterns were observed throughout the whole crack surface.
