Improvements and mechanisms of fracture and fatigue properties of well-dispersed alumina/epoxy nanocompositesIn an earlier paper [Zhao S, Schadler LS, Hillborg H, Auletta T, Duncan R. Mechanisms leading to improved mechanical performance in nanoscale alumina filled epoxy. Compos Sci Technol 2008], a model system of nanoscale alumina filled bisphenol A based epoxy with two interface conditions was used to highlight the mechanisms leading to significant improvements in ductility, tensile toughness and modulus. In this paper, the fracture toughness and fatigue crack propagation (FCP) rate of the materials used in the preceding paper were measured as a function of interface condition to gain further insight into the mechanisms leading to enhanced mechanical performance. No significant improvement in fracture toughness or fracture energy was observed. A significant improvement in FCP resistance was observed for both nanocomposites, but the improvement was larger for the composites with a stronger particle/matrix interface. The crack arresting mechanisms include particle matrix debonding, plastic void growth, and in the nanocomposites with a stronger interface, significant plastic deformation of the matrix around the well-bonded nanoparticles.['In the preceding paper [bib1], the mechanisms leading to enhanced ductility in nanoscale alumina/epoxy matrices was reported.
 Two interface conditions were investigated: the nascent interface, which lead to a weak interface, and a silane modified interface with covalent bonding to the epoxy.
 Particle debonding, plastic void growth and crack deflection were present in both composites, but both plastic void growth and crack deflection were more prevalent for the stronger interface condition.
 In this paper, the fracture and fatigue crack propagation behavior of the nanocomposites were studied in order to gain further insight into the mechanisms leading to improved mechanical performance.
', 'Brittle epoxies are often toughened using micron-sized soft rubber particles or rigid particles [bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6]. However the stiffness or ductility is often reduced due to the addition of the soft or rigid fillers.
 Recently, nanosized fillers have been shown to increase toughness, modulus, and ductility simultaneously [bib7 bib8 bib9 bib10]. There have been several reports of improved ductility and toughness in brittle thermoset polymers due to the addition of equiaxed nanoparticles.
 Kinloch et al. [bib11] showed that the addition of a low concentrations of nanosilica (SiO2) particles to a typical rubber-toughened epoxy, based upon a two-part epoxy formulation, lead to a significant increase in the fracture toughness or energy (<i>K</i> Ic or <i>G</i> Ic) of the resin.
 In addition [bib12], the value of <i>G</i> Ic increased from 103J/m2 for the pure epoxy polymer to over 1400J/m2 upon the formation of the ‘hybrid’ material containing both rubbery micron-sized particles and nano-SiO2 particles in a hot-cured single-part epoxy.
 Plastic deformation of the matrix, crack deflection and twisting around particles, and crack front pinning by rigid particles were the main toughening mechanisms of this ‘hybrid’ epoxy polymer.
 Johnsen et al. [bib13] reported that the fracture toughness, <i>K</i> Ic, increased significantly for nanosilica filled epoxy compared with the neat polymer.
 They reported that the primary toughening mechanism was plastic void growth.
 Wetzel et al. [bib14] showed that the fracture toughness, <i>K</i> Ic, of nanoalumina filled epoxy composite increased by 60% at a filler content of 5 vol.%; the FCP resistance of the nanocomposites also improved.
 They attributed the improvement to crack deflection, plastic deformation and crack pinning.
 More recently, Blackman et al<i>.</i>  [bib15] reported a significant improvement in both the initial toughness, <i>K</i> Ic, and the cyclic-fatigue behavior, thresholdΔ  K th  , of the epoxy by introducing nanosilica.
 This result is noteworthy, however the mechanism leading to the improvement of the fatigue behavior was not mentioned.
', 'The different mechanisms observed by these authors may be due to differences in the strength of the interface between the nanoparticles and the matrix.
 The relationship between the strength of the interface for nanoscale fillers and toughening mechanisms is not well understood.
 This paper attempts to clarify the mechanisms operating in nanofilled composite for two interface conditions.
 The strong interface was achieved by silane surface treatment of the nanoparticles, however the untreated nanoparticles led to the weak interface.

 [fig1] shows the dispersion in the NT-Al2O3 and APTES-Al2O3 nanocomposites; many of the nanoparticles were individually dispersed.
 Only a few aggregates (approximately 4–8) with a diameter of 2–6μm on the 3×3 mm cross-section of each nanocomposite were observed (not shown here). A comparison of [fig1](b) and (d) show that the nanoparticle/epoxy adhesion was stronger for the APTES-Al2O3 nanocomposites, which was due to the surface treatment of Al2O3 nanoparticles by APTES silane.
']], ['Fracture toughness and energy', ['The fracture toughness and fracture energy values of the neat polymer, NT-Al2O3 and APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites are shown in [tbl1]. It is clear that although the fracture toughness of both nanocomposites increased with the nanofiller content, the <i>K</i>Ic values of the APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites are slightly higher than that of the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites through the whole filler loading range.
 The fracture energy of the APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites, however, which includes the Young’s modulus, did show a significant increase was optimized around 10–15phr nanoparticle loading.
 There was, however, no significant change for the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites.

 applied stress intensity range ( Δ   K  I  ) for the neat polymer, 10phr NT-Al2O3 and 10phr APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites.
 [fd1]). A transition point, at  Δ   K  T =  0.27  MPa m  , is observed.
 This behavior is similar to that observed in some rubber particle filled epoxy [bib31], in which rubber cavitation and matrix dilation only occur above certain  Δ   K  I   values.
 The observation of this transition point in our nanocomposites may indicate that the operating mechanisms are different for  Δ   K  I   levels below and above  Δ   K  T  . Above this transition point, the enhancement brought about by the nanoparticles is clear and very significant improvements in reducing the crack growth rate can be clearly seen: (i) The fatigue crack growth rate increases more slowly with applied stress intensity range for both the nanocomposites than for the neat polymer; (ii) the APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposite shows the highest FCP resistance compared to the other two materials at the same  Δ   K  I   value.
 In addition, the Paris Law constant <i>C</i>0 and <i>n</i> are calculated by curve fitting and are listed in [tbl2].', 'Both a smaller <i>C</i>0 and a smaller <i>n</i> indicate a retardation of the crack growth rate.
 The value of the Paris law exponent <i>n</i> drops from 10 for the pure epoxy to 7 for 10phr (3.1 vol.%) NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites, and further to 5 for 10phr (3.1 vol.%) APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites.
 Azimi et al. [bib31] reported that the Paris law exponent <i>n</i> decreased from 9.0 for the neat epoxy to 6.8 for 10 vol.% glass microcapsules and 4.9 for 10 vol.% rubber micro-particles.
 In addition, the value of the intercept <i>C</i>0 drops from  42.1  ×   10  -3   ( mm/cycle(MPa m  )  n  ) for pure epoxy to  0.39  ×   10  -3   ( mm/cycle(MPa m  )  n  ) for 10 phr NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites, and further to  0.07  ×   10  -3   ( mm/cycle(MPa m  )  n  ) for 10phr APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites.
 All of these results show that fatigue crack propagation in the epoxy is impeded by the Al2O3 nanoparticles; furthermore, this effect is stronger for the surface treated APTES-Al2O3 nanoparticles than the NT-Al2O3 nanoparticles.
']], ['Fracture morphology', ['The <i>K</i>Ic fracture surface morphologies for the neat polymer, NT-Al2O3 and APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites are shown in [fig3](a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), respectively.
 In the neat polymer, large, straight primary cracks with a smooth region in between are seen ([fig3](a)). This indicates that once the stress intensity factor <i>K</i> reaches its critical value <i>K</i>Ic, the crack propagates very fast and straight until failure.
 The fracture surfaces of the NT-Al2O3 and APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites are quite similar ([fig3](b) and (d)). It is clear that both the 10 phr NT-Al2O3 and 10 phr APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites have a rougher fracture surface, indicating increased surface roughness as a result of adding nanoparticles.
 Debonding and plastic void growth, which were the mechanisms observed on the tensile test fracture surfaces of the nanocomposites at high magnification [bib1], are not seen here ([fig3](c) and (e)).', 'The fracture morphology of the fatigue crack growth rate (FCGR) test samples close to the pre-crack position for the neat polymer, 10phr NT-Al2O3 and 10phr APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites are shown in [fig4]. The crack propagation direction is indicated by the white arrow.
 The fracture morphologies near the pre-crack of the FCGR test samples ([fig4]) are quite similar to that of the <i>K</i>Ic test samples ([fig3]). In the neat polymer, straight primary cracks can be seen once the crack starts propagating ([fig4](a)). In the 10phr NT-Al2O3 and 10phr APTES-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites, small secondary cracks and detailed structures are observed ([fig4](b) and (c)).', 'Away from the pre-crack position, the fatigue cracks propagate during cyclic stresses; therefore fatigue striations should be observed.
 [fig5] shows the fatigue striations on a FCGR test sample for the neat polymer (applied  Δ   K  I   ∼0.5 MPa m  ). The crack growth direction is from the right-up comer to the left-bottom comer.
 [fig6] shows the fatigue morphology of a FCGR test sample for the 10phr NT-Al2O3 nanocomposite at different magnifications.
 Fatigue striations are still clear ([fig6](a)). With increasing magnification, however, more river lines, debonding, plastic void growth and particle pull-out mechanisms can be seen ([fig6](c) and (d)). We observed these mechanisms for the NT-Al2O3/epoxy nanocomposites in a low crack-propagation-speed tensile test [bib1], but not for the high crack-propagation-speed fracture toughness test.
 In the present low frequency fatigue test, the applied stress intensity range is only about 1/3 to 1/2 of the <i>K</i>Ic value, and the crack propagation rate is much lower than in the fracture toughness test.
', '[fig7] shows the fatigue striation morphology on a FCGR test sample for the 10phr APTES-Al2O3 nanocomposite at different magnifications.
 Unique 3D plastic deformation of the matrix around the nanoparticles can be clearly observed.
 The well-bonded APTES-Al2O3 nanoparticles or small aggregates of few nanoparticles act as pinning positions and induce plastic deformation of the matrix during the low crack-propagation-rate fatigue test.
