Synthesis of Exfoliated PMMA/Na-MMT Nanocomposites via Soap-Free Emulsion PolymerizationPMMA/Na-MMT nanocomposites were synthesized through a soap-free emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) using 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS). A conventional anionic surfactant, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid sodium salt (DBS-Na), was also used to compare with AMPS in the interaction with pristine Na-MMT. Both surfactants were intercalated into the layers of the pristine Na-MMT dispersed in water before polymerization. The nanocomposites with AMPS were exfoliated during polymerization because AMPS made the polymer end-tethered on pristine Na-MMT. The nanocomposites were exfoliated up to the 10 wt % content of pristine Na-MMT relative to the amount of MMA. The molecular weight of PMMA obtained from the nanocomposite with AMPS decreased, and the glass transition temperature (Tg) and storage modulus (E′) of the nanocomposites became higher as the amount of Na-MMT increased. ['In recent years, much attention has been paid to polymer/silicate nanocomposites, because they have the higher stiffness and stronger strength with a small amount of silicate than conventional composites.
 They also showed dimensional stability and flame-retarding property.
3 The Toyota group had reported that nylon- 6/silicate4-7 nanocomposites showed balanced mechanical properties such as tensile strength and modulus.
 These unique properties of polymer/silicate nanocomposites resulted from the high degree of dispersion of silicates in polymer matrix.
 Exfoliated polymer/ silicate nanocomposites are regarded as lightweight and high-performance composites because delaminated clays with high aspect ratio layers offer large surface areas to polymers.
 Various methods to delaminate silicate layers and get a polymer/silicate nanocomposites with a good mechanical properties are melt intercalation,8-18 in-situ polymerization, 19-27 and curing systems.
28-34 From the other point of view, silicate-like layers35-40 in the presence of organic components have been prepared by sol-gel methods.
 Layered silicates1,23,24 were also used as catalyst supports decades ago.
 Natural silicates1,2 have strong interaction between layers due to negative charges and hydrogen bond in their crystal structures.
 The basal space of pristine silicate is about 1 nm, which is smaller than the radius of gyration of general polymers.
 This might be an obstacle for polymers to penetrate into or delaminate silicate layers.
 So, most hydrophobic polymers have limits to penetration into layer region of hydrophilic silicates.
 Up to now, the preparation of polymer/silicate nanocomposites has been mainly based on organically modified layered silicates (OLS),41-50 in which sodium montmorillonite (Na-MMT) is modified with alkylammoniums, showing hydrophobic characters.
 This paper tries to describe a simple and convenient way to obtain the exfoliated PMMA/silicate nanocomposites through an in-situ54 polymerization with a reactive surfactant.
 Water makes the basal space of silicate layers widen without any chemical treatment.
 A reactive surfactant, 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS),51-53 has amido and sulfonic acid contents in the molecule.
 Strong interaction of amido moiety with pristine silicates may make the polymer end-tethered on silicate layers.
 Sulfonic acid acts as a surface-active material. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) exhibits high optical clarity and modulus, so we expect its silicate nanocomposites will provide enhanced mechanical properties approaching those values of engineering plastics, and copolymerization of MMA with vinyl monomers will lead to a new family of polymer/silicate nanocomposites.
 This paper will examine the role of two types of surfactantssa reactive surfactant and a conventional anionic surfactantson morphology and mechanical properties of PMMA/clay nanocomposites.

['Figure 1 shows infrared spectra of the reactive surfactant (AMPS), pristine Na-MMT, A2.5M20T0%, and A2.5M20T5%. In the name of sample, M denotes the monomer, MMA, A stands for AMPS, T for pristine Na-MMT, D for DBS-Na, and the numbers following A, D, and M indicate the weight of components.
 In spectrum of A2.5M20T5%, characteristic absorbance bands of PMMA, AMPS, and Na-MMT occur in the following assignment: CH stretching 2937 cm-1, CdO stretching 1732 cm-1, C-O stretching 1194 and 1147 cm-1 neighboring Si-O stretching (1034 cm-1) reveal the characteristic bands from PMMA, and NH bending 1543 cm-1, SdO stretching 1383-1251 cm-1 reveal those of AMPS.
 Absorbance peaks from OH stretching at about 3634 cm-1, Al-O stretching 610 cm-1 and Si-O bending 469 cm-1 confirm the presence of pristine Na-MMT in the PMMA/Na-MMT nanocomposite.
 Disappearance of the absorbance peak at 1610 cm-1 corresponding to vinyl stretching of AMPS reveals the high conversion of monomers in the polymerization for the nanocomposite production.
 Figure 2 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of A2.5M20 series (a) and A0.3M20 series (b) after THF extraction for 12 h.
 The pristine Na-MMT has the basal space of 1.14 nm.
 No peak is observed, which means the delamination of silicates in PMMA/Na-MMT nanocomposites or a gap widening between layers above 5.89 nm.
 In this experiment, the nanocomposite has the exfoliation of silicate up to 10 wt % of Na-MMT.
 When DBS-Na, a conventional anionic surfactant, is used, X-ray diffraction patterns show the peaks at angle of 6.5° for D2.5M20T10% and at 6.0° for D2.5M20T5% in Figure 3, corresponding to the basal spaces of 1.36 and 1.47 nm, respectively.
 D2.5M20T1% shows two peaks: one strong peak at 3.0° and the other weak and broad peak at 5.4° in 2θ, which correspond to the basal spaces of 3.0 and 1.75 nm, respectively.
 The latter peak is considered as d001 spacing of pristine Na-MMT.
 The former peak will turn out to be caused by the intercalation of DBS-Na into silicate layers (refer to Figure 7). Two peaks indicate the two types of intercalated states of silicate.
 Figure 4a,b represents the basal space variation with time during polymerization.
 A2.5M20T10% shows no peak, and the exfoliation of silicates in a short time less than 10 min after polymerization is initiated.
 But the sample A0.3M20T10% shows the slow disappearance of peak and the slow gap widening of silicate layers.
 But, for D2.5M20T10% in Figure 5, two peaks are observed at about 6.8° and 3.0° in 2θ values throughout polymerization.
 As the polymerization proceeds, the peak at 6.8° shifts to 6.5° that is the same position for the extracted nanocomposite of D2.5M20T10% in Figure 3. So the peak at 6.5° is caused by the intercalation of PMMA into the silicate layers.
 In Figure 6, the peak of pristine Na-MMT dispersed in water is detected at the 2θ angle of 5.7° corresponding to the basal space of 1.55 nm, and the Na-MMT dispersed with MMA in water shows the peak around 3.0° with the basal space of 3.27 nm.
 The latter has two peaks at the angles of 3° and 6°. It is believed that the intercalation of MMA in pristine Na-MMT layers causes the appearance of peak at 3.0°. When the surfactants are used, no peak is shown.
 The samples with surfactants in Figure 6 were freezedried.
 Their X-ray patterns are shown in Figure 7. The peaks for the Na-MMT with AMPS appear at 7.5° and 3.8°. The peak at 7.5° corresponds to the peak for pristine Na-MMT.
 The peak at 3.8° is caused by the intercalation of AMPS into silicate layers.
 In the case of DBS-Na, two peaks appear at 2.9° and 6.6°, and the basal spaces are thought to become wider than those for AMPS.
 It is concluded that the peak at 3.0° of D2.5M20T1% in Figure 3 is caused by the intercalation of DBS-Na which is not fully extracted out of Na-MMT.
 In Figure 8a, curve 1 is for A0.3M20T5% extracted with THF for 5 days.
 Curve 2 is the nanocomposite extracted again by the reverse ion exchange in THF/LiCl solution after the extraction with THF.
 A0.3M20T5% has the residual molecules of 32 wt %. It indicates the strong interaction between residual molecules and silicate layer surface.
 In the D2.5M20T5% case, most polymers are removed by the THF extraction, and about 4.6% of residual molecules remain in the silicate layers.
 Lee20 reported the residual polymer was caused by a strong interaction such as the ion-dipole interaction.
 With TGA analyses of A0.3M20T5% and D2.5M20T5%, we propose a mechanism of exfoliation of Na-MMT with AMPS.
 The sodium dissociated from silicates will associate with sulfate ion of AMPS to form sulfonic acid sodium salt, which is a surface-active material. A0.3M20T5% has more residual molecules than D2.5M20T5%. It suggests that AMPS remain as an endtethered form inside silicate layers.
 Figure 9 represents 1H NMR spectra of PMMA obtained from of A0.3M20T0%, A0.3M20T5% by the extraction with THF, and A0.3M20T5% by reverse ion exchange.
 Figure 9c is the1H NMR spectrum for the residual molecules end-tethered on silicate layers.
 Methoxy protons of MMA show the peak at 3.6 δ and methylene protons show peaks in the range 2.2-1.5 δ. The peak at 1.27 δ is for the isotactic, 1.04 δ for the heterotactic, and 0.8 δ for the syndiotactic molecules.
 From Figure 9a-c, acetone, a solvent of NMR, shows a peak at 2.05 δ, and from Figure 9c, the peak for THF appears at 3.89 δ. Those peaks are typical spectra of PMMA.
 Unfortunately, peaks of AMPS are not discernible in those peaks because the amount of AMPS is very small. The tacticity of polymers obtained from Figure 9a-c is listed in Table 1. Interestingly, the end-tethered molecule has more isotactic configuration of methylene proton and less heterotactic configuration than bulk PMMA.
 Alexandre Blumstein and co-workers55,56 reported the similar tendency in tacticity for PMMA; that is, the PMMA polymerized in Na-MMT had more isotactic but less syndiotactic configuration than the bulk PMMA.
 Molecular weights of PMMA are listed in Table 2. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of the polymer polymerized with AMPS decreases as the amounts of act as monomer absorbers like micelles do, so the local concentrations of MMA and AMPS near silicates will be elevated and emulsion particles will be formed faster than when no Na-MMT is available.
 The molecules end-tethered on silicate layers exhibit a very low molecular weight (about 490) in Table 2. It can be explained in the following way; after the exfoliation of silicates, most molecular chains end-tethered on silicate layers encounter with second radicals and terminate by coupling.
 Figure 10 shows thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) as a function of weight losses of nanocomposites.
 The weight loss at about 200 °C in Figure 10a is due to the decomposition of AMPS, whose decomposition temperature is 200 °C.
 The main chain in PMMA decomposes at about 280-450 °C.
 The analysis of A0.3M20 series in Figure 10b shows the thermal stability of the nanocomposites up to 300 °C.
 The analysis of D2.5M20 series in Figure 10c shows the thermal decomposition of PMMA in the range 350-420 °C.
 For A0.3M20 series, the storage modulus, E¢, at 40 °C increases with the amount of pristine Na-MMT as shown in Figure 11a.
 Specially, the nanocomposites containing 5% and 10% of pristine Na-MMT have the highly elevated moduli.
 The D2.5M20 series also show the increase in storage modulus with pristine Na-MMT content.
 A0.3M20T5% has the 44% higher value of storage modulus than D2.5M20T10%. Glass transition temperatures of A0.3M20 series are obtained from the maximum temperature of tan ä in Figure 12a.
 Their values are 149 °C for A0.3M20T0%, 154 °C for A0.3M20T1%, 151 °C for A0.3M20T5%, and 156 °C for A0.3M20T10%, indicating the increase in Tg with the content of pristine Na-MMT.
 On the contrary, the D2.5M20 series show the decrease in Tg with the contents of pristine Na-MMT: 154 °C for D2.5M20T0%, 152 °C for D2.5M20T1%, 146 °C for D2.5M20T5%, and 142 °C for D2.5M20T10% in Figure 12b.
 The enhancement of storage modulus and the rise in Tg of A0.3M20 series result from the delamination of silicates in PMMA matrix and strong interaction between residual molecules and silicate layers.
 TEM is used to confirm the morphology of nanocomposites in Figure 13, in which pristine Na-MMT layers look like dark strips and PMMA appears as white domains.
 Layers of Na-MMT in A2.5M20T10% are well distributed and delaminated, so the exfoliated morphology of Na-MMT is confirmed.
 For D2.5M20T10%, stacked layers of Na-MMT are observed in PMMA matrix, and the intercalated morphology is shown, which is consistent with XRD data.
