Multi-scale reinforcement of CFRPs using carbon nanofibersIn this paper, stacked-cup carbon nanofibers (CNF) were dispersed in the matrix phase of carbon-fiber-reinforced composites based on a high-performance epoxy system with and without modification by an elastomeric triblock copolymer (TCP) for increased toughness. The addition of the TCP provided an enhancement in toughness at the cost of a slight degradation in modulus and strength. The CNFs, on the other hand, provided significantly enhanced strength and stiffness in matrix-dominated configurations, including tension of quasi-isotropic composites and short beam shear strength of both quasi-isotropic and unidirectional composites. Scanning electron microscopy revealed enhanced adhesion between the matrix and carbon fibers with the addition of either TCP or CNFs. However, CNF agglomeration in the studied systems partially offset the energy dissipation processes brought about by the nanofibers, thereby limiting interlaminar fracture toughness enhancements by CNF addition. These results show good promise for CNFs as low-cost reinforcement for composites while offering insight into the codependent morphologies of multi-scale phases and their influence over bulk properties.['Carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRP) are characterized by low weight, high strength and stiffness, and low coefficients of thermal expansion in the fiber direction, making them attractive in a wide variety of applications in wind energy, transportation, aerospace design, and sporting equipment, among others.
 Superior strength-to-weight ratios are a primary motivational factor for the incorporation of CFRPs [b0005], but these composite materials can also be designed with multifunctionality, replacing non-structural elements while enhancing structural integrity.
', 'High-performance composite systems often incorporate highly crosslinked epoxy adhesives to hold together the load-bearing carbon fibers.
 These glassy networks offer high creep and corrosion resistance, good adhesion to carbon fibers, and high working temperatures as determined by their high glass transition temperatures (<i>T</i>g ), yet they are also highly brittle and insulating [b0010]. As a result, CFRPs suffer from poor matrix-dominated mechanical properties such as interlaminar fracture toughness and transverse electrical and thermal conductivity, particularly in matrix-rich interlaminar regions between carbon fibers.
', 'Thus, many studies have focused on toughening the matrix component of CFRPs to improve their mechanical robustness.
 Rubber-toughening through the addition of discrete rubber particles enhances toughness but also degrades the thermomechanical properties of crosslinked polymer networks [b0015 b0020]. Amphiphilic block copolymers undergo reaction induced phase separation (RIPS) during the curing process to yield similar rubbery domains that are anchored into the matrix by epoxy-miscible blocks, providing similar toughening with reduced degradation in thermomechanical properties due to control over morphology [b0025 b0030]. The addition of a rigid thermoplastic is another effective method of toughening with low degradation in the thermomechanical properties of the matrix [b0035 b0040 b0045]. While these approaches have been partially successful, new strategies to improve toughness while maintaining or improving thermal properties and simultaneously addressing additional needs such as transverse electrical conductivity are needed.
', 'In this light, nanoparticles have the potential to toughen the matrix phase and offer the added benefit of multifunctionality for simultaneous enhancements in other properties.
 For example, clay nanoplatelets offer enhanced flexural modulus and barrier properties [b0050 b0055]. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) enable enhanced health monitoring and improved mechanical, electrical and thermal properties in traditional fiber-reinforced systems [b0060 b0065 b0070 b0075 b0080]. Cho et al. reported an increase in interlaminar fracture toughness of ∼15% with 0.5wt.
% CNTs [b0080]. Bekyarova et al. grew CNTs on carbon fiber surfaces for enhanced interactions, yielding tensile modulus and strength improvements of ∼30% and 15% over the base composites, respectively [b0075]. Veedu et al. grew CNTs on SiC fiber surfaces by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and found enhancements in interlaminar fracture toughness of ∼386% (CNT content unknown) [b0065]. Unfortunately, CNT growth from carbon fibers often results in non-uniform coverage or damage to the carbon fibers, making this method difficult to optimize for CFRPs [b0085]. Furthermore, a major limitation of this “hybrid” approach to composites containing both microscale carbon fibers and nanoparticles is the high expense associated with many nanoparticles.
', 'Thus, carbon nanofibers (CNF), which offer a good compromise between performance and cost compared with CNTs [b0090 b0095], are an ideal candidate for incorporation into CFRPs.
 Previous studies have shown good promise, with a 100% increase in mode I interlaminar fracture toughness at only 1wt.
% CNF, as reported by Tsantzalis et al. [b0100]. An increase of up to ∼160% in mode I interlaminar fracture toughness was observed by Yokozeki et al. through a combination of an epoxy phase with 5wt.
% CNFs and a CNF-rich film in the region of crack propagation [b0105]. Still, there have been limited studies on hybrid composites containing CNFs, particularly on systems incorporating high-performance epoxies (<i>T</i>g  >250°C), which are particularly difficult to toughen in light of their exceptionally high crosslink densities [b0110].', 'CNFs and CNTs are both composed of graphene sheets, yielding similar electrical and thermal properties [b0115 b0120]. However, the stacked-cup structure of CNFs entails graphitic stacking of helically coiled graphene sheets or ribbons oriented at an angle with respect to the nanofiber axis ([f0005] ) [b0125 b0130 b0135]. This unique structure enables failure modes such as unraveling or splaying of the coiled graphitic sheets, which offer new pathways for toughening of nanostructured composite systems [b0140].', 'In this study, we have investigated the influence of various amounts of stacked-cup carbon nanofibers in “hybrid” composite systems containing both micro- and nano-scale carbon fibers.
 The matrix phase in the composite systems under study consisted of either a “base” high-performance epoxy or the same epoxy “toughened” with 5phr (parts per hundred resin by weight) of a commercial elastomeric triblock copolymer (TCP) in order to determine the effect of a second polymer phase in the matrix component of these hybrid composites and to take advantage of synergistic toughening of the epoxy matrix.
 The resultant composites were characterized mechanically and electrically in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy to understand the interactions between the reinforcing phases and their influence on macroscopic properties.

 [f0010] shows the tensile properties as a function of CNF content for both the base and toughened composite systems, as indicated by the blue and red bars, respectively.
 [f0010]a presents the Young’s modulus for the unidirectional composites, showing no significant change through the addition of either CNFs or TCP since the alignment of the carbon fibers with the testing direction yields a fiber-dominated response with very limited influence of matrix-phase reinforcements.
 However, the simultaneous addition of both CNFs and TCP degrades the modulus by about 7%, which may be due to agglomerated CNFs reducing the efficiency of stress transfer or to morphological changes in the TCP domains induced by the CNFs, as discussed in Section [s0045].', 'In contrast, the quasi-isotropic composite moduli shown in [f0010]b reveal a dependence on both of the matrix-phase reinforcements because the misalignment of the carbon fibers in most of the plies with the testing direction imparts an increased influence of the matrix phase.
 A modest degradation of modulus is observed through the incorporation of the elastomeric triblock copolymer in the toughened systems, yet an enhancement of ∼10% is observed in both the base and toughened systems with 1phr CNF.
 A plateau is observed at 3phr CNF, likely due to agglomeration as described below.
 [f0010]c indicates a modest reduction in strength accompanied by a modest increase in failure strain in the toughened system at a given CNF content, as expected for the addition of a softer, more compliant material in the matrix.
', 'Short beam shear tests of small rectangular specimens were performed to gain insight into the shear behavior of the composites, with the short beam strength presented in [f0015]a.
 Despite the different failure modes, both composite orientations exhibited enhanced strength – approximately 15% and 22% in the unidirectional and quasi-isotropic composites, respectively – with the addition of CNFs, with minimal degradation brought about by the incorporation of the weak triblock copolymer into the stiff matrix.
 It is worth noting that the 15% increase in ILSS is relative to a high baseline value of 115MPa in the unidirectional system.
', '[f0015]b presents the results of open-hole compression tests on the quasi-isotropic composites.
 However, an increase is observed in the slope of the stress versus extension curves with CNF addition, again demonstrating the stiffening effect of the CNFs observed in [f0010]a.
 [f0020]a shows a delaminated surface of a neat (0phr CNF) base composite.
 However, the addition of CNFs to the matrix phase yields increased tortuosity in the fracture surface, indicating increased damage prior to failure ([f0020]b). Moreover, matrix-phase “sheaths” can be found surrounding the carbon fibers with the addition of either CNFs ([f0020]c) or TCP ([f0020]d), suggesting improved adhesion between the matrix and carbon fibers due to the complex interactions between the constituent phases.
', 'Nonetheless, the large-scale CNF agglomeration at 3phr CNFs ([f0020]c, top) reduces the efficacy of CNF reinforcement due to stress concentrations in regions of clustered CNFs.
 Despite this agglomeration, enhancements by up to 200% are observed in the transverse electrical conductivity of the composites with the addition of CNFs ([f0025]), as similarly observed by Bekyarova et al. by incorporating CNTs into CFRP systems [b0075]. Because of the anisotropy in carbon fiber electrical conductivity, as well as the insulating nature of the polymer adhesive, the transverse conductivity of CFRPs with continuous fibers is often significantly lower than the longitudinal conductivity.
 Nonetheless, the interlaminar fracture toughness of the unidirectional composites could still be found as a function of crack extension from the arrest position of the unstable cracks, as shown by representative curves in [f0030]a (Note: there is no <i>R</i>-curve corresponding to the toughened unidirectional composite with 1phr CNFs due to the absence of a Teflon film in the cured composite). Despite the initial instability, <i>R</i>-curve behavior was still observed in all composite systems, with increasing magnitude for the composites containing either CNFs or TCP, indicating toughening by both reinforcing phases in the matrix.
', 'Even though initiation <i>G</i>Ic values could not be obtained as described above, the steady-state interlaminar fracture toughness of both the unidirectional and quasi-isotropic composites is shown in [f0030]b.
 In both orientations, the addition of TCP to the base system without CNFs resulted in an enhanced toughness between 25% and 50%, verifying the “toughened” nature of the TCP-modified systems brought about by the improved CF/matrix adhesion and plastic deformation of the rubbery TCP domains.
 The modest magnitude of these enhancements is consistent with reports indicating limited effectiveness of TCP-toughening for increasing crosslink density of epoxy systems [b0110]. The addition of 1phr CNFs also yields modest toughening, with enhancements of ∼10% and 20% in GIc in the unidirectional and quasi-isotropic composites, respectively.
 The lack of more significant toughening, as well as the disappearance of any toughening influence at 3phr CNFs, is most likely due to stress concentrations around agglomerated CNFs, which offset the energy-dissipative mechanisms brought about by stacked-cup CNFs as discussed elsewhere [b0140].', 'Despite the limitation in toughening caused by agglomeration, SEM analysis of fracture surfaces was implemented to investigate the toughening mechanisms imparted by the reinforcing phases.
 As noted above, the presence of CNFs in the matrix phase yields rougher surfaces than the mirror-like surfaces of neat epoxy-rich regions, indicating crack deflection around the CNFs ([f0020] b). Closer inspection reveals CNF pullout and rupture, with the former being more prevalent ([f0035]a). In addition, dangling sheets at the end of exposed CNF segments indicate overcoming of interlayer <i>π</i>–<i>π</i> interactions by unraveling of the coiled sheets, as observed previously [b0140]. [f0035]b shows a fracture surface of a toughened composite without CNFs, revealing 1–2μm domains of TCP with either spherical vesicle or salami-like domain morphologies [b0155 b0160]. The former consist of epoxy-rich cores surrounded by TCP-rich coronae, whereas the latter have smaller epoxy-rich domains in oblong TCP-rich domains.
 When CNFs are incorporated into the toughened system ([f0035]c), the TCP domains near CNF surfaces decrease in size by about an order of magnitude and take on a spherical micelle morphology.
 Both of these factors have been attributed to decreased effectiveness in toughening of block-copolymer-modified epoxy composites [b0160 b0165], which may be the primary source of the antagonistic response for the toughened composite with 1phr CNFs shown in [f0030]b.
 Finally, multiple segmental rupture is observed, likely due to local weakening of the CNF structure due to splaying [b0140].']], ['Glass transition temperature of hybrid composites', ['The glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>g) of the unidirectional composite systems as determined by the peak in the loss tangent during a temperature ramp by DMTA is presented in [f0040]. The addition of a rubbery phase into epoxy systems often yields significant degradation in <i>T</i>g due to plasticization [b0015], whereas interactions between the matrix and nanoparticle surfaces often modify local chain dynamics, thereby creating an interphase that can percolate through the material and either raise or lower <i>T</i>g [b0170 b0175 b0180]. However, the addition of either TCP or CNFs in the present systems results in a very low extent of degradation in <i>T</i>g, due to the discrete, phase-separated nature of the TCP domains [b0025], as well as suppression of interphase creation in light of the exceptionally high crosslink density of the epoxy network [b0185]. A larger decrease in <i>T</i>g is observed in the toughened composite with CNFs, which may be due to increased local miscibility of the TCP in the vicinity of CNFs, as suggested by the reduction in TCP domain size compared to the toughened system without CNFs ([f0035] c).']]].
