Experimental study on the thermal and mechanical properties of multi-walled carbon nanotube-reinforced epoxyIn this study, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were infused into Epon 862 epoxy through a high intensity ultrasonic liquid processor and then mixed with EpiCure curing agent W using a high-speed mechanical agitator. The trapped air and reaction volatiles were removed from the mixture using a high vacuum. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and flexural tests were performed on unfilled, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4wt% CNT-filled epoxy to identify the loading effect on the thermal and mechanical properties of composites. DMA studies revealed that filling the carbon nanotube into epoxy can produce a 90% enhancement in storage modulus and a 22°C increase in <i>T</i>
                     g. However, due to the lower crosslink density of the nanophased systems, a 6°C decrease in decomposition temperature was observed in the 0.4wt% CNT/epoxy in the TGA test. The flexural results showed that modulus increased with higher CNT loading percentages and the 0.3wt% CNT-infusion system showed the maximum strength enhancement. Based on the experiment's results, a nonlinear constitutive equation was established for neat and nanophased epoxy.['Due to their high specific strength and specific stiffness, fiber-reinforced composites have become attractive structural materials not only in the weight-sensitive aerospace industry, but also in the marine, armor, automobile, railway, civil engineering structures, and sporting goods industries.
 Generally, the in-plane tensile properties of a fiber/polymer composite are defined by the fiber properties, while the compression properties and properties along the thickness dimension are defined by the characteristics of the matrix resin.
 Epoxy resin is the polymer matrix used most often with reinforcing fibers for advanced composite applications.
 The resins of this class have good stiffness, specific strength, dimensional stability, and chemical resistance, and show considerable adhesion to the embedded fiber [bib1]. Using an additional phase, such as inorganic fillers, to strengthen the properties of epoxy resins has become a common practice [bib2]. Because micro-scale fillers have successfully been synthesized with epoxy resin [bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6], nanoparticles, nanotubes, and nanofibers are now being tested as filler material to produce high performance composite structures with enhanced properties [bib7 bib8 bib9].', 'Carbon nanotubes are excellent candidates for nano-reinforcing a variety of polymer matrices because of their strength, thermal conductivity, electrical capacity, stiffness, and thermal stability.
 Nanophased matrices based on polymers and carbon nanotubes have attracted great interest because they frequently include superior mechanical, electronic, and flame-retardant properties.
 Different polymer/CNT nanocomposites have been synthesized by incorporating carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into various polymer matrices, such as polyamides [bib10], polyimides [bib11 bib12 bib13], epoxy [bib14], polyurethane [bib15 bib16] and polypropylene [bib17 bib18 bib19].', "The purpose of this paper is to show the effect of carbon nanotubes on the thermal and mechanical properties of Epon 862 epoxy.
 An ultrasonicator was used to process the CNT-epoxy nanocomposite.
 Flexural tests were performed to evaluate mechanical performances.
 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) were performed to evaluate thermal performances.
 Microscopic approaches were used to investigate the material's fracture behavior and mechanisms.

[['Thermal properties', ['[fig1] shows the DMA plots of storage modulus versus temperature as a function of loading carbon nanotubes.
 The addition of 0.4wt% of carbon nanotube yielded a 93% increase of the storage modulus at 30°C.
 The high aspect ratio and elastic modulus of CNTs, as compared to nanoclay [bib20], increase the storage modulus with smaller amounts of CNTs.
', 'The loss factor curve, tan<i>δ</i>, of the neat epoxy and its nanocomposites measured by DMA are shown in [fig2]. The peak height of loss factor decreased with higher CNT content, but the temperature determined from the peak position of tan<i>δ</i>, <i>T</i>g, increased to 17°C.
 Similar results have been observed in other nanocomposites [bib21].', 'The peak factor, <i>Γ</i>, is defined as the full width at half maximum of the tan<i>δ</i> peak divided by its height, and it can be qualitatively used to assess the homogeneity of the epoxy network.
 For the nanophased epoxy, the peak factor increased with higher CNT weight percents ([fig3]). The higher peak factor for the nanophased epoxy indicates a greater heterogeneity.
', '[fig4] shows the TGA of all nanocomposite categories in this study.
 All samples started to decompose around 340°C and completely decomposed around 460°C.
 The decomposition temperatures decreased with higher CNT content ([fig5]).']], ['Flexural response', ['Typical stress–strain behavior from the flexural tests is shown in [fig6]. All specimens failed immediately after the tensile stress reached the maximum value.
 Five specimens were tested for each condition; the average properties obtained from these tests are listed in [tbl1].', 'The modulus of the nanophased epoxy increases continuously with higher CNT content ([tbl1], [fig6]). The tensile modulus improved by 11.7% with an addition of 0.4wt% of CNTs.
 However, the system with 0.3wt% infusion is the best, with a 28.3% tensile strength enhancement ([tbl1], [fig6]). The strength begins to degrade with 0.4wt% loading, although the gain in modulus is maintained.
 See [fig7] for the relationship between modulus, strength, and CNT weight fraction.
 Previous results have also indicated that, using the acoustic cavitation method, the optimal loading of carbon nanofibers in epoxy is 2.0wt% [bib22] and the optimal loading of SiC nanoparticles in epoxy is 1.0wt% [bib7]. The other one, voids may have also decreased the strength.
 Choi et al reported that few voids were produced during the fabrication process and that voids increased with the higher nanoparticle contents [bib21].']], ['Fracture surface', ['The fracture surfaces of the neat epoxy and its nanocomposites were comparatively examined using SEM.
 The initial crack occurred at the tension edge of both the neat and nanophased specimens ([fig8]A and B). Neat epoxy resin exhibits a relatively smooth fracture surface and the higher magnification SEM picture in [fig8]C indicates a typical fractography feature of brittle fracture behavior, thus accounting for the low fracture toughness of the unfilled epoxy.
 The distance between two cleavage steps is about 40um and the cleavage plane between them is flat and featureless.
 For example, the failure surface of the nanocomposite containing 0.3wt% CNTs are rougher with the CNTs added into the epoxy matrix ([fig8]B, D and F). The higher magnification SEM picture in [fig8]E shows that the size of the cleavage plane decreased to 10um after the infusion of the CNTs.
', '[fig9]A and B show the low magnification fracture surfaces of 0.1wt% CNT/epoxy and 0.3wt% CNT/epoxy, respectively.
 [fig9]C (0.1wt%) and [fig9]D (0.3wt%) indicate that the size of the cleavage plane has decreased with higher CNT content.
 The high magnification pictures of the cleavage plane of 0.3% system ([fig9]E) show that CNTs were uniformly dispersed in the epoxy.
 The flat cleavage planes were formed by the network of cleavage steps and each plane contains at least one carbon nanotube ([fig9]F). During the failure process, the crack propagation changed direction as it crossed CNTs.
', 'When the CNT content increased to 0.4wt%, a large particle, an agglomeration of several carbon nanotubes ([fig10]B), was observed in the fracture surface ([fig10]A). At a low stress level, the agglomerated particle increased the stiffness of the material, but at a high stress level, the stress concentration caused by the agglomerated particle initiated a crack, which made the sample fail quickly.
