Polyamide-6,6/in situ silica hybrid nanocomposites by sol–gel technique: synthesis, characterization and propertiesThe organic–inorganic hybrid nanocomposites comprising of poly(iminohexamethyleneiminoadipoyl), better known as Polyamide-6,6 (abbreviated henceforth as PA66), and silica (SiO2) were synthesized through sol–gel technique at ambient temperature. The inorganic phase was generated in situ by hydrolysis–condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) in different concentrations, under acid catalysis, in presence of the organic phase, PA66, dissolved in formic acid. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy was used to monitor the microstructural evolution of the silica phase in the PA66 matrix. Wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) studies showed that the crystallinity in PA66 phase decreased with increasing silica content. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the nanocomposite films revealed the dispersion of SiO2 particle with dimensions of <100nm in the form of network as well as linear structure. X-ray silicon mapping further confirmed the homogeneous dispersion of the silica phase in the bulk of the organic phase. The melting peak temperatures slightly decreased compared to neat PA66, while an improvement in thermal stability by about 20°C was achieved with hybrid nanocomposite films, as indicated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) exhibited significant improvement in storage modulus (<i>E</i>′) for the hybrid nanocomposites over the control specimen. An increase in Young's modulus and tensile strength of the hybrid films was also observed with an increase in silica content, indicating significant reinforcement of the matrix in the presence of nanoparticles. Some properties of the in situ prepared PA66-silica nanocomposites were compared with those of conventional composites prepared using precipitated silica as the filler by solution casting from formic acid.['Inorganic–organic hybrid nanocomposites using the sol–gel process where the inorganic phase is grown in situ is being actively pursued globally [bib1 bib2 bib3]. The shift in emphasis from the traditional practice of mechanically blending the reinforcing fillers into a polymeric matrix to the sol–gel process is due mostly to the subtle control over morphology and/or surface characteristics of the growing inorganic phase in the polymer matrix by control of various reaction parameters like pH, concentration, temperature, etc.
 More importantly, unlike the traditional composites, which have macroscale domain size varying from micrometer to millimeter scale, the inorganic–organic hybrids have domain sizes varying typically from 1 to 100nm [bib4]. Thus, the inorganic–organic hybrids are usually optically transparent, even though microphase separation may exist.
 Sol–gel hybrid preparation mostly centers on the growth of the inorganic phase from the hydrolysis–condensation of alkoxysilanes like TEOS in a solution containing the organic polymer.
 The mechanism of hydrolysis–condensation of TEOS is well known [bib5]. [sc1]  depicts the formation of the three-dimensional silica network arising as an outcome of the hydrolysis and condensation reactions of TEOS.
 So far, many hybrids have been prepared in this way using poly(vinyl acetate) [bib6 bib7], poly(methyl methacrylate) [bib8 bib9], poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) [bib9], poly(ethylene oxide) [bib10], poly(dimethylsiloxane) [bib11], Nafion®  [bib12 bib13], poly(vinyl alcohol) [bib14] and several other polymers.
 From our laboratory, we have reported several nanocomposites including those prepared by the sol–gel technique [bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18].', 'The novelty of this work lies in the fact that the silica nanophase has been grown in situ within the Polyamide-6,6 (PA66) matrix probably for the first time.
 The present paper describes a comparison of spectroscopic, morphological, thermal, mechanical, dynamic mechanical and water absorption properties of silica composites with those of PA66 and an attempt has been made to explain the properties with the structure of the nanocomposites.
 For comparison, optical and morphological properties of precipitated silica-PA66 composites prepared by solution blending technique have been reported.
 It is worth mentioning that nanocomposites based on polyamides (particularly polyamide-6) and nanoclay has commercial potential [bib19].'].
[['IR studies', ['The IR spectrum of N66T0 (neat PA66) and N66T5 are shown in [fig1](a) with all the characteristic peaks labeled.
 Neat PA66 films show the characteristic peaks at 3320cm−1 (N–H stretch), 2938cm−1 (CH2 stretch), 1640cm−1 (CO stretch, amide I), 1540cm−1 (in-plane N–H deformation, amide II), 1370cm−1 (CN stretch+in-plane NH deformation, amide III), 1200cm−1 (amide III coupled with hydrocarbon skeleton) and 934cm−1 (C–CO stretch, crystalline band) respectively as reported previously by other researchers [bib22 bib23 bib24]. The bands at ∼1020–1080cm−1 in the IR spectrum of the silicate nanocomposites are assigned to the asymmetric Si–O–Si stretching and provide a measure of the degree of network polymerization [bib12]. (The differences between the FTIR spectra of N66T0 and N66T5 are qualitative and the quantitative aspect becomes clear when [fig1](b) is considered as discussed below.
) The ∼800cm−1 vibration is associated with symmetric Si–O–Si skeletal stretching, while the 460cm−1 band appears due to Si–O–Si bending mode.
 The bands observed in the region ∼930–950cm−1 are assigned to Si–OH (silanol) stretching and broad bands centered near 3400cm−1 are assigned to various hydrogen-bonded SiO–H (silanol) stretching vibrations.
', 'Quantitative IR analysis was carried out by calculating specific absorbance ratios relevant to the presence of the silica phase in the PA66 matrix.
 The absorbance value of the 1640cm−1 peak was taken as the internal reference band as reported by previous researchers [bib22 bib23] and was used as the denominator in the absorbance ratio calculations to eliminate the thickness variation in the compression molded films.
 The plots of absorbance ratio against TEOS loading for a few representative peaks are shown in [fig1](b). The ratio of the absorbance value at 934cm−1 to the absorbance value at 1640cm−1, represented symbolically as <i>A</i>934/<i>A</i>1640, continually increases at high TEOS loading.
 The band at ∼934cm−1 for neat PA66 signifies a crystalline band as mentioned above and in the system under study the Si–OH stretching peak also occurs at the same position.
 The absorbance ratios <i>A</i>1080/<i>A</i>1640, <i>A</i>1063/<i>A</i>1640 and <i>A</i>1041/<i>A</i>1640 also show a general increasing trend with increasing TEOS loading.
 This hints at simultaneous increase in both network as well as linear structures with TEOS loading up to 3wt%. However, from 5wt% TEOS loading and above, the network structure formation gets predominance over linear structures.
 This is evident from the increasing difference in the absorbance ratio between <i>A</i>1080/<i>A</i>1640 and <i>A</i>1041/<i>A</i>1640 and between <i>A</i>1063/<i>A</i>1640 and <i>A</i>1041/<i>A</i>1640 in [fig1] (b). The symmetric Si–O–Si stretching vibration occurring at 800cm−1 also increases with increasing SiO2 content as evident from the <i>A</i>800/<i>A</i>1640 ratio.
 The ratio <i>A</i>3400/<i>A</i>1640 also increases with increasing TEOS loading indicating the increase in silanol moieties as a result of acid catalyzed hydrolysis of TEOS in the hybrids.
 The increase in all the absorbance ratios indicates increased interaction between the in situ generated silica phase and PA66 and this interaction is probably in the form of labile hydrogen bonds.
 Thus the PA66/silica hybrid nanocomposites fall under the classification of class I materials (where the inorganic and organic components interact only weakly through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals contacts or electrostatic forces) as proposed by Sanchez and Ribot [bib25]. These hydrogen bonds probably reinforce the polymer structure and results in loss of flexibility of the hybrid composite films with increasing TEOS loadings (noticeable at 10% TEOS loading and above as described later).']], ['Light transmittance studies', ['Quantitative visible light transmittances of the films are shown in [fig1](c). The transmittance values of the nanosized silica/PA66 hybrid composites are near to that for the neat PA66 film (N66T0) which proves that the in situ generated silica is well-dispersed within the organic matrix and their domain sizes are lower than that of visible light.
 However, the Vulkasil loaded PA66 composite (N66V3) is slightly more translucent compared to PA66T10, which is probably due to the aggregation and/or agglomeration of the precipitated silica particles compared to the in situ generated nanosized silica.
 The corresponding qualitative transparency results are tabulated in [tbl1].']], ['X-ray studies', ['WAXS was used to investigate the changes in crystalline structure of the PA66-silica nanocomposite samples.
 The WAXS scans of the nanocomposite samples are stacked in [fig2]. Usually, the peaks at 2<i>θ</i> values of ∼20.2 and 23.6° signify the existence of the α phase in PA66. It was previously known that PA66 can exist only in the α and β crystalline forms at room temperature [bib26]. Under certain circumstances the γ crystalline phase also exists along with the α phase in PA66 at room temperature [bib27]. However, the α phase is more stable than the γ phase at room temperature and that is why the α→γ phase transformation in PA66 occurs much above room temperature (the well known phenomenon of Brill transition) [bib28].', 'In the present system, the α phase peaks, viz.
 <i>α</i>1 and <i>α</i>2 occur at ∼20.2 and ∼23.6°, respectively, and the <i>γ</i>1 peak occurs at ∼13.3°. There is no <i>γ</i>2 peak.
 However, Liu et al. [bib27] observed both <i>γ</i>1 and <i>γ</i>2 peaks in PA66/clay nanocomposites.
 The <i>α</i>1 peak arises from the distance between the hydrogen-bonded chains and the <i>α</i>2 peak arises from the separation of the hydrogen-bonded sheets [bib29]. The peak maximum along with the corresponding <i>d</i>-spacing for the samples are tabulated in [tbl2]. The data in [tbl2] prove that there is neither any peak shift nor any significant shift in <i>d</i>-spacing even with increase in TEOS loading from 0 to 10wt%. This probably means that the polymerized silica occupies the free volume of the polymer.
 Jain et al. [bib30] made the observation that the non-occurrence of diffraction peaks at 2<i>θ</i> values of ∼12 and 19° in PA66 confirmed the absence of the β form of PA66. Therefore, the 2<i>θ</i> values ranging from 13.2 to 13.4° in the present system most probably belong to the <i>γ</i> form of PA66. Since, the <i>γ</i>1 peak is present in all the samples, it confirms that it is an artifact of the solution casting and/or the thermal history and not due to the silica generated in situ in the system.
', 'The near absence of the <i>α</i>1 peak in N66T0 is explainable on the basis of reduced perfection of the crystallites and/or size due to the film preparation technique.
 Similar WAXD patterns have been observed by Haruvy et al. [bib31] in the nylon-6 system prepared by compression molding.
 They have also reported that the perfection of the crystallites and/or their size increased (as evidenced from the sharper <i>α</i>1 and <i>α</i>2 peaks) as a result of annealing.
 We obtained a similar trend in our system upon annealing of the films at 200°C for 3h in vacuum.
 As all the films were prepared and subjected to the same conditioning, the comparison of the unannealed films is meaningful. On subsequent addition of TEOS, the <i>α</i>2 peak decreases in intensity and <i>α</i>1 peak intensity slowly increases as evident from [fig2]. The decrease in the <i>α</i>2 peak intensity implies loss of hydrogen bonding between CO and N–H groups and this may be due to the interference of the silanol groups which increases quantitatively with increase in TEOS loading from 0 to 10wt% as mentioned in the IR discussion.
 The percent crystallinity from WAXS is mentioned in [fig2] against the sample curves.
 On addition of 1% TEOS, the drop in crystallinity is ∼15% from the neat polymer.
 The maximum drop in crystallinity occurs for N66T10 where the crystallinity is 37% less than that in N66T0. The decrease in crystallinity is probably due to the loss in hydrogen bonding between the CO and N–H groups situated on neighboring chains due to in situ generation of nanosized silica as mentioned above.
']], ['Microscopic studies', ['The AFM phase image for N66T5 is shown in [fig3](a). The presence of linear silica structures is seen to be predominant with some amount of network formation also.
 The lengths of the linear structures runs into the micron range while the width varies between 50 and 70nm.
 Discrete nanosized silica particles (<50nm) are also dispersed throughout the matrix.
 [fig3](b) shows the SEM micrograph of N66T5 and the presence of linear silica structures is evident.
', '[fig4] compares the Si mapping of N66T3, N66T5, N66T10 and N66V5. It is evident that there is slight aggregation of silica in the N66T10 film and substantial aggregation of silica in the N66V5 film.
 However, there is no aggregation in the nanocomposite films having TEOS loading of 3 and 5wt%. Since, the agglomeration of the silica particles in N66T10 film is not very substantial, the transparency of the film is not much affected.
']], ['Thermal characterization of the PA66-silica nanocomposites', ['The PA66 melting was studied by performing DSC on N66T0, N66T3, N66T5 and N66T10. The second heating DSC traces of the samples are compared in [fig5]. A summary of the DSC data corresponding to the curves for the heating scan are tabulated in [tbl3]. The data indicate that with increasing TEOS loading the melting peaks gradually decreased in comparison to neat PA66 (the heat of fusion values reflect this trend). More surprising was the fact that the in situ generated nanosized silica did not cause any increase in crystallinity.
 Incorporation of silica particles within the chain interstices decreases the overall crystallinity probably by reducing the hydrogen bonding interaction between CO and N–H groups on the PA66 backbone and for this the silanol groups may be primarily responsible.
 From [fig5] it is seen that two melting peaks occur for the neat PA66 and PA66/silica nanocomposites.
 The higher temperature melting peak has been designated as <i>T</i>m1, while the lower temperature one as <i>T</i>m2 in [tbl3]. According to Khanna [bib32], this double melting phenomenon ascribed due to a bimodal crystallite distribution is common to nylons like PA66 and is a characteristic of melts crystallized at a cooling rate of 10°C/min.
 Further, the appearance of the dual melting peaks in both the neat PA66 and PA66/silica nanocomposites proves that this is not due to the presence of nanosized silica generated in the system under study.
', 'The DSC cooling scan for the unannealed films are shown in [fig6] and all the scans show only one exothermic peak.
 The peak (<i>T</i>p) and onset of crystallization (<i>T</i>o) temperatures are listed in [tbl3] along with the respective heat of crystallization (Δ<i>H</i>c) values.
 Similar results have been reported previously on polyamide 6-based clay nanocomposites [bib33].', 'The TGA measurements of neat PA66 and PA66/silica nanocomposites with different TEOS loadings are shown in [fig7]. The onset of thermal degradation (<i>T</i>d) mentioned in [fig7] proves that the thermal stability of the nanocomposites increases up to 3wt% TEOS loading and then decreases thereafter with increasing TEOS loading.
 However, all the TEOS loaded films showed increased <i>T</i>d compared to neat PA66 film.
 <i>T</i>d is shifted by 18°C for the composite with only 0.8wt% of silica nanoparticles.
 This initial increase in the thermal stability of the nanocomposites is most likely the consequence of the attachment of the PA66 chains to the surface of the in situ generated silica.
 This physical crosslinking network along with the residual crystallinity and other bonding forces at temperatures higher than the <i>T</i>m of PA66 is responsible for this thermal behavior.
 However, after a threshold concentration (0.8wt% silica) is exceeded, the in situ generated silica most probably does not have much effect on the decomposition characteristics of the composites.
 The residue left at 800°C is in line with the experimental silica content as reported in [tbl1] and this result indicates that the thermal decomposition routes of neat PA66 and PA66/silica nanocomposites are same.
 It should be noted that polyamide-6/organoclay nanocomposites showed lower thermal stability than neat polyamide-6 as reported by Cho and Paul [bib34]. Therefore, with as low as 0.2wt% silica loading (corresponding to TEOS loading of 1wt%) the thermal stability improvement of the PA66/silica nanocomposites is substantial.']], ['Mechanical and dynamic mechanical properties of the PA66-silica nanocomposites', ["Typical tensile stress–strain curves for the unannealed films are presented in [fig8](a). Tensile stress–strain characteristics of the N66T15 film could not be determined as the film was very brittle in nature and could not be die-punched to get the tensile specimen.
 All the PA66/silica nanocomposite films having TEOS loading 1–10wt% showed an increase in the Young's modulus (<i>E</i>) over neat PA66. However, the modulus value reached a maximum for the N66T5 film and then dropped to a lower value for the N66T10 film.
 It is well known that in semicrystalline polymers like PA66, the crystallinity plays a major role in shaping the mechanical properties.
 With increase in the TEOS content, the crystallinity decreased (as observed from the WAXS and DSC studies). Since, the modulus depends substantially on crystallinity for PA66, the modulus should have decreased, but instead it increased.
 With only 1.5wt% of theoretical silica content (N66T5) the modulus increased ∼75% compared to neat PA66 (N66T0). The trends in the modulus, maximum tensile stress (MTS), work to break (WB) and elongation at break (EB) behavior of neat PA66 and PA66/silica nanocomposite films are compared in [fig8](b) and (c). The trend in each case is in line with that of the modulus and thus can be explained probably by the opposing factors of decrease in crystallinity and reinforcing action of nanosized in situ generated silica filler acting in tandem.
 Further, the agglomeration tendency of the in situ generated silica particles also has a role in influencing the mechanical properties of the films having TEOS loading of 10wt% and above.
 It is observed that the optimization in mechanical strength is reached in the case of N66T5 and the increase in MTS, WB and EB is ∼14, 425 and 193%, respectively.
 A similar trend was reported in the case of PEBAX®/silica nanocomposites previously [bib35]. The increase in EB of the PA66/silica nanocomposites over neat PA66 can be explained probably on the basis of the linear and network growths of the inorganic phase as observed from the IR and AFM studies.
 However, there is optimization at a TEOS loading of 5wt%, and above that the EB gets lowered probably due to the fact that too much of silica network structures would mean agglomeration of the silica particles.
 Si mapping ([fig4]) shows that aggregation/agglomeration starts from N66T10 and thereby supports this proposition.
 This agglomeration leads to the increasing brittle nature of the films from TEOS loading of 10wt% and above.
", 'The variation of tan<i>δ</i> and storage modulus (<i>E</i>′) with temperature for the films are shown in [fig9](a) and (b), respectively.
 The <i>T</i>g (glass transition temperature) for N66T0 occurs at ∼24°C and for N66T5 there is a significant shift of ∼+12°C in <i>T</i>g from the N66T0 peak.
 The tan<i>δ</i> peak heights of all the PA66/silica nanocomposites are greater than that for the neat PA66 film, which confirms the decrease in crystallinity with increasing TEOS loading.
 The <i>T</i>g values of neat PA66 and PA66/silica nanocomposites are all below the usually reported <i>T</i>g value of ∼70–80°C for dry-as-molded (DAM) specimens.
 This gets reflected in the tan<i>δ</i> curves in [fig9](a) by almost no shift in the <i>T</i>g values (in the case of N66T1 and N66T3) even though there is a significant improvement in the storage modulus values with increased TEOS loading as noticed from [fig9](b). The shift of the <i>T</i>g peak for the N66T5 film may be a result of optimization of the opposing effects of moisture absorption, decrease in free volume with increment in silica loading and reinforcement due to nanosized silica.
 The factors like free volume decrease with increment of silica loading, moisture-absorbing behavior and agglomeration of the silica probably determine the <i>T</i>g shift of N66T10. From [fig9](b) it is seen that the <i>E</i>′ values for the PA66/silica nanocomposites are above that of neat PA66 in the temperature range of −50–200°C and can be explained on the basis of reinforcing action of nanosized in situ generated silica.
 Among all the composites, the N66T5 exhibits the highest storage modulus value.
 The lowering of the <i>E</i>′ trace for the N66T10 film compared to the N66T5 film can be explained on the basis of predominant effect of crystallinity decrease and silica agglomeration.
']], ['Water absorption behavior', ['The water uptake characteristics of unannealed neat PA66 and PA66/silica nanocomposites are compared in [fig10]. It is well-known that PA66 is hydrophilic and tends to absorb water easily from the surrounding environment.
 From [fig10] it is seen that the nanocomposite films N66T1 and N66T3 have slightly higher water absorbing tendency than N66T0, whilst N66T5 and N66T10 have lower water absorbing tendency.
 Initially the network structure formed is lower on a volume basis due to the lower quantity of TEOS loading and the crystallinity decrease as a result of TEOS loading (as evident from [tbl3]) also aids in increase in water absorption compared to N66T0. With increase in TEOS loading, the free volume of the polymer decreases as the polymerized silica fills up the free volume of the polymer.
