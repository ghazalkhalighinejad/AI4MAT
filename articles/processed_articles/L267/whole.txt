Effects of surface modification on rheological and mechanical properties of CNT/epoxy compositesDespite superior properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), physical properties of the CNT/epoxy composites are not improved significantly because interfacial bonding between the CNTs and the polymer matrix is weak. CNTs were treated by an acidic solution to remove impurities and modified subsequently by amine treatment or plasma oxidation to improve interfacial bonding and dispersion of nanotubes in the epoxy matrix. The functional groups on the surface of treated CNTs were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The surface modified CNTs were embedded in the epoxy resin by ultra-sonication and the cured nanotube containing composites were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy. Rheological properties of nanotube containing epoxy resin and mechanical properties of the modified CNT/epoxy composites were improved because the modification of CNTs improved dispersion and interaction between the CNT and the epoxy resin.['Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 [bib1] by Iijima, have become of keen interest to material scientists.
 CNTs are rolled sheets of hexagonal array of the carbon atoms with the diameter ranging from a few angstroms to several tens of nanometers.
 CNTs have very good mechanical properties because the two-dimensional arrangement of carbon atoms in a graphene sheet allows large out-of-plane distortions, while the strength of carbon–carbon in-plane bonds keeps the graphene sheet exceptionally strong against any in-plane distortion or fracture [bib2]. Moreover, CNTs have high aspect ratio, good electrical, and physical properties.
 Due to the unique properties of carbon nanotubes, they have been used for nanoscale electron devices such as field emission displays, atomic force microscope tips, and hydrogen storage cells.
', 'CNTs have been used as extremely strong nano-reinforcements for composites, which possess extraordinarily high strength with low weight and moderate electrostatic discharge properties [bib3]. However, the scope of CNT applications in practical devices has been largely hampered by their poor dispersion in polymer resin and weak interfacial bonding with polymer matrix [bib4]. Therefore, chemical modification of the CNT surface and good dispersion of carbon nanotubes are required for industrial applications of the CNTs.
 Surface treatment of the CNTs may roughly be classified into two categories: one is generation of the nanotube-bound carboxylic acid and the other is direct attachment of functional groups to the graphitic surface [bib5]. Chemical oxidation and amine treatment are included in the first category.
 The CNTs are opened at the end and the terminal carbons are converted to carboxylic acids by oxidation in concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids.
 Jian Chen et al. reported generation of acid groups by attaching long alkyl chain with an octadecylamine to the CNT surface [bib6]. Through the chemical reaction, amide linkage and carboxylate-ammonium salt are formed on the surface of CNTs [bib7].', 'The second category includes gas plasma treatment.
 The plasma treatment is a useful method because it permits the fixation of different chemical groups on the surface.
 Moreover, this kind of treatment is used to modify the surface without changing the characteristics of CNTs [bib8]. It can be carried out by applying cold gas plasma for short period of time.
 The plasma is also known as the glow discharge plasma, which is obtained when the gas is exposed to an electromagnetic field of radio frequencies at low temperature and low pressure [bib9].', 'In order to achieve optimal enhancement in the properties of CNT/polymer composites, two key issues should be considered: homogeneous dispersion of CNTs in the polymer resin and strong interfacial bonding between the CNTs and the polymer matrix.
 Measurement of the rheological property is useful to examine changes in dispersion state and interfacial bonding affected by surface modification.
 There are a few reports on rheological behavior of CNT/polymer composites.
 Pötschke et al. [bib10] investigated rheological properties of the CNT/polycarbonate composites.
 It was found that the increase in the viscosity of the composites filled with CNTs was higher than that of polymer composites filled with carbon fibers or carbon blacks.
 Kinloch et al. [bib11] studied the rheological behavior of oxidized CNTs dispersed in aqueous solution by considering the interaction between the CNT.
 They reported that the dispersion state of the CNT was highly sensitive to applied strain in the linear viscoelastic region and the storage and loss moduli were independent of frequency.
 Mitchell et al. [bib12] examined the linear viscoelastic properties of composites prepared with pristine single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and organically modified SWNTs in polystyrene matrix.
 It was found that the composites filled with functionalized CNTs had better dispersion and showed higher storage modulus and dynamic shear viscosity at low frequency.
', 'The purpose of this study is to examine the rheological properties of surface modified CNT filled epoxy composites prepared by ultra-sonication.
 The influence of surface modification of CNTs on the linear viscoelastic response was examined by measuring dynamic shear viscosity, storage modulus, and loss modulus.
 Extensional flow behavior of CNT/epoxy composites was also observed, which has not been reported previously.
 The morphologies of composites were investigated by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and mechanical properties were also investigated by a universal testing machine (UTM).'].
 Each peak is fitted by using binding energy of standard carbon, 284.5eV.
 [fig1]  shows the C ls XPS spectra of untreated and modified CNTs.
 The asymmetric peak at 284.6eV is assigned to sp2-hybridized graphite-like carbon atoms and sp2 carbon atoms bound to hydrogen.
 In [fig1] (a), the peak at 285.3eV is originated from sp3-hybridized carbon atoms and is similar to that of the diamond-like carbon.
 In [fig1](b), the peak at 286.2eV is a typical peak of carbon atoms bound to oxygen atoms by single bond from the influence of carboxylic acid.
 In [fig1](c), a peak exists at 285.3eV generated by shifting the main peak and a peak at 287.2eV is originated from carbon atoms bound to one oxygen by a double bond by the influence of oxygen plasma.
', '[fig2]  shows the O ls XPS spectra of untreated and modified CNTs.
 In [fig2](a), specific oxygen peaks do not exist.
 Two peaks at 531.7 and 533.0eV in [fig2](b) (acid treated CNTs) are originated from oxygen atoms bound to carbon atoms in the functional groups like alcohol (C <i>O</i>H), carboxylic acid (C<i>O</i>OH or OC <i>O</i> CO), respectively.
 Plasma treated CNTs have the characteristic oxygen peak of carbonyl group (CO) as shown in [fig2] (c) [bib13 bib14] and the result corresponds to that of C 1s XPS spectra.
 The untreated CNTs dispersed in the polymer matrix exist in the form of agglomerates as shown in [fig3] . The fuzzy appearance of the agglomerate is typical for the composites prepared by the manufacturing method employed in this study [bib15]. The white regions in [fig3](a) represent the aggregated CNTs and the region is magnified as shown in [fig3](b) in order to verify the existence of CNTs.
 In [fig3], epoxy resin do not infiltrate into agglomerates of the untreated CNTs and the dry areas are delaminated from each other.
 But acid treated CNTs are dispersed well as shown in [fig4] (a). In the magnified image as shown in [fig4](b), it is shown that CNTs are pulled out slightly.
 As illustrated in [fig5] (a), the amine treated CNTs are dispersed poorly in the polymer resin compared with acid treated CNTs.
 But [fig5](b) shows that CNTs are broken instead of being pulled out during tensile test because of better interfacial bonding between the amine treated CNTs and the polymer resin.
 [fig6] (a) shows that plasma treated CNTs are dispersed well in epoxy resin.
', 'Rheological behaviors of the pure epoxy, the untreated CNT/epoxy composites, and the surface modified CNT/epoxy composites are shown in [fig7] (a). The surface modified CNT/epoxy composites exhibit a very strong shear thinning behavior whereas the pure epoxy behaves like a Newtonian fluid [bib10]. The epoxy composites containing surface modified CNTs have higher shear viscosity than those containing untreated CNTs because interfacial bonding between the CNTs and the epoxy resin becomes stronger when the CNT surface is modified.
 Storage and loss moduli are plotted in [fig7](b) and (c). Although both moduli increase with frequency, the increasing rate of the moduli becomes smaller as the CNT surface is modified.
, strain hardening occurs as the Hencky strain,ε   (   0   ,   t   )   = ε   ˙  0t , is increased.
 [fig8]  shows extensional viscosity versus Hencky strain for composites containing 1wt% of CNTs.
', '[tbl1]  lists mechanical properties and [fig9]  shows stress–strain curve of pure epoxy and cured nanocomposites containing CNTs.
 In particular, tensile strength of the plasma treated CNT/epoxy nanocomposite is increased by 124% compared with that of pure epoxy.
', 'The elastic modulus of the nanocomposite is predicted by applying the Halpin-Tsai model [bib16] which was proposed to predict the elastic properties of polymer composites that contain short fibers oriented in axial direction.
 The model states that the elastic modulus of the short fiber reinforced composite is predicted by   (1)   Ec  Em=   1+ζη ϕf 1-η ϕf  where <i>E</i> c and <i>E</i> m are elastic moduli of the composite and matrix, respectively, <i>ζ</i> is a shape parameter dependent upon filler geometry and orientation, and <i>ϕ</i> f is the volume fraction of fillers.
 The density of CNT is calculated by assuming that the graphitic layers of the tube shell have the same density as that of the fully dense graphite structure (<i>ρ</i> g =2.25gcm−3) because it is hard to measure the exact density [bib17]. By measuring the inside and outside diameters, the density of CNTs can be calculated by the following equation.
   (2)  ρ  CNT =ρg   ( d2   - di2   )   d2  where <i>d</i> and <i>d</i> i are outside and inside diameters of CNTs, respectively.
 <i>η</i> is defined by   (3) η  =Ef   / Em   -1   Ef   / Em   +ζ   where <i>E</i> f represents the Young’s modulus of the fiber.
 Ashton et al. [bib18] determined that <i>ζ</i> =2(<i>l</i>/<i>d</i>) for prediction of the axial modulus, <i>E</i> 11, where <i>l</i> and <i>d</i> are length and diameter of the filler.
 On the other hand, <i>E</i> 22, the modulus perpendicular to the fiber orientation was found to be relatively insensitive to fiber aspect ratio and could be approximated by <i>ζ</i> =2 [bib18 bib19]. As a result, the elastic modulus of the composite containing randomly oriented short fibers is given by the following equation.
   (4)  E  ran-3D  fibers =  0.184   E  11 +  0.816   E  22', 'The above formula is an approximated equation derived by van Es et al. by using laminate theory [bib20 bib21].', 'The elastic modulus is calculated in this study for the nanocomposite composed of epoxy and as-received CNTs by assuming perfect interfacial bonding and homogeneous dispersion.
 The calculated value is 1.82GPa.
