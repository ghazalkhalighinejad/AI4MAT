Dielectric properties of modified graphene oxide filled polyurethane nanocomposites and its correlation with rheology['Polyurethane (PU) is an industrially important synthetic elastomer due to its excellent flexibility, elasticity and damping ability.
 These properties together with its high melt processability and tunable physical properties make this thermoplastic elastomer applicable in coatings, adhesives, foams, biomimetic materials and various diversified fields of modern technologies [b0005]. PU also possesses a high tensile strength, abrasion, tear resistance, and solvent resistance and combines properties of elastomers as well as thermoplastics.
 However, the applicability of PU (especially PUs having a small amount of hard segments) is still limited by its low stiffness, inferior gas barrier properties and poor conductivity [b0010]. Among various nanofillers employed for composite fabrication with the objective to enhance the physical properties of PU, graphene and graphene oxide (GO) have utmost importance owing to their unique properties such as stiffness, strength, specific surface area, thermal conductivity and gas impermeability [b0015].', 'Since the properties of polymer nanocomposites largely depend on the dispersion of nanofillers within the matrix and the filler–polymer compatibility and interfacial interaction, several modifications of graphene fillers have been employed; often depending on the polymer nature [b0010]. A number of studies report on GO and functionalised graphene filled PU [b0020 b0025 b0030]. Khan et al. reported extremely stiff PU containing 55wt% graphene [b0035], but the elasticity of PU was seriously deteriorated.
 GO consist of many polar groups such as hydroxyl, epoxide, ether and carboxylate groups as the result of oxidation [b0040]. Due to its polar nature, GO has only limited solubility in organic solvents and nonpolar polymers; thus necessitating surface treatments to improve the performance of the nanocomposites.
 Stiffness and scratch resistance of PU significantly enhance by GO addition [b0045]. However Nguyen et al. disclosed non-covalent interfaces leading to poor reinforcing effect of GO [b0050]. Thus the ideal interface for stress transfer was proposed to be covalent bonds forming between graphene/GO and the matrix PU [b0025 b0055 b0060].', 'In the present work the quality of dispersion of GO in PU is enhanced by introducing methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). The isocyanate (NCO) group at the end of the linear PU interacts with the oxygen groups on the GO.
 Solution mixing is employed in order to achieve a better dispersion of GO in the PU matrix and the filler concentration is varied from 0 to 3wt%. Using MDI the GO filler surface is also modified.
 The dynamic mechanical, dielectric and rheological properties of the PU/GO nanocomposites were determined and compared with those of PU/isocyanate modified GO (mGO) nanocomposites and neat PU.
 Here the stiffness and toughness are enhanced without deteriorating the storage modulus.
 The qualitative information of dispersion from rheology is related with its quantitative assessment from dielectric property and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) depending on the filler concentration and reinforcement state.
 The extent of GO exfoliation in the final composites was characterized by X-ray diffraction scattering and electron microscopy.
 The entire study aims at developing a GO nanocomposite applicable in electronics.
'].
 Samples of GO and mGO were coated on oxidized silicon wafers for good contrast in AFM imaging and tapping mode images were obtained as shown in [f0005]a and b.
 The interplanar distances of GO and mGO are found to be roughly 1.5 and 3.3nm respectively.
 [f0005]c and d respectively give the contact angles for the GO and mGO films.
 With a tilt angle of 0°, the true contact angle was determined as the average of the left and right hand side values.
 The calculated average contact angle value for the GO film is 96.5°±4 whereas for mGO, it is 152.5°±6 ([f0005]c), thus proving the hydrophilicity of GO and hydrophobicity of mGO.
 The thermogravimetric analysis performed on mGO ([s0090]) further confirms its hydrophobicity as no mass loss is evidenced at <180°C temperature due to the grafted benzyl groups (from MDI) on mGO surface.
 The FTIR ([s0090]) spectrum also assures GO modification by MDI.
']], ['Composite microstructure', ['Composite morphology was monitored using SEM micrographs of the cryo cut surfaces of PG3 and PMG3 samples ([f0010]). The effect of filler nanosheets on the microstructure of the PU is very lucid from the pictures shown.
 The smooth fractured surface of pristine PU ([f0010]a) became rough due to the presence of GO ([f0010]b). Here the exfoliated GO nanosheets are uniformly dispersed in the PU medium as evidenced by the PU/GO composite morphology.
 For mGO composites, a comparatively better dispersion of the mGO nanosheets is observed, which can be attributed to the increased interaction between PU and mGO as compared to GO ([f0010]c).', 'To further analyze the GO and mGO dispersion in the polymer, the structural variation within the filler as well as the composites was investigated through XRD studies.
 As shown in the XRD pattern ([f0015]a), the characteristic sharp peak of graphite at 2<i>θ</i>=26.5° is more broadened ([f0015]a, insite) and shifted to 2<i>θ</i>=5.3° in GO.
 In the composite samples, the case is rather different ([f0015]b). The neat PU is soft in nature (32% HS) and the peak obtained near 2<i>θ</i>=21° is a crystalline halo attributed to its elastomeric structure.
 For PU/GO and PU/mGO, the peak intensity marginally enhances though it remains at the same position at 2<i>θ</i>=21°. This can be related to the crystallinity imparted to the PU matrix by the GO (or) mGO addition.
 GOs possess a strong nucleating effect within the polymer matrix [b0070]. In addition, the XRD spectrum of the nanocomposites shows no characteristic peak at 5°, originating from the loss of regularity or exfoliation of the GO (or) mGO in the PU, which indicates the good dispersion of fillers in PU.
 [e0005] [b0075]: (1) ε r   ε m   = |f   c  - f|   -   s  Here <i>ε</i>r is the effective dielectric constant, <i>ε</i>m is the dielectric constant of the polymer matrix, <i>f</i>c is the percolation threshold, <i>f</i> is the volume fraction of metal or inorganic filler, and <i>s</i> is a scaling constant (∼1). Low <i>ε</i>r/<i>ε</i>m values can be attributed to a poor dispersion of the filler in the composites and weak filler–polymer interactions, thus correlating dielectric spectroscopy with the microstructure of the composite.
', 'The dielectric constant <i>ε</i>′ and dielectric loss <i>ε</i>″ of PU nanocomposites over a frequency range of 10−2 to 106 Hz at room temperature are presented in [f0020]a and b.
 With the incorporation of GO/mGO, the dielectric constant for filled PU films measured at different frequencies increased significantly from PG0.5, PG1.5, PG3, PmG0.5, PmG1.5 and PmG3 films respectively.
 But here in these systems, PMG3 proves to be capable of producing stable nanocomposite films of high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss.
', 'According to the Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars (MWS) process, the presence of a polymer–filler interface can lead to changes in dielectric properties [b0080]. When current flows across the two-material interface, charges can be accumulated at the interface between two dielectric materials with a different relaxation time (<i>τ</i>=<i>ε</i>/<i>σ</i>, where ε is the dielectric permittivity and σ is the conductivity). The nanocomposites have a huge interfacial area, which in turn provides numerous sites for the reinforced MWS effect as compared to microcomposites [b0080]. For PU/GO composites, the value of the permittivity constant raised towards low frequencies, which is 3 times that of the pure matrix.
 When comparing the dielectric losses of the different composites at 0.01Hz, mGO composites show very high dielectric loss whereas GO composites have a much lower dielectric loss.
 [f0020]c and d illustrates the variation in storage modulus <i>G</i>′ ([f0020]c) and loss modulus <i>G</i>″ ([f0020]d) at 160°C as a function of angular frequency.
', 'On increasing the filler loading from 0.5 to 3wt% a noticeable qualitative change in the moduli versus frequency curves was observed, particularly significant at low frequencies.
 The compatibilizing agent, polymer molecular weight, interfacial properties and filler dispersion influence the linear viscoelastic properties [b0085]. The properties are also affected by the gelation of filler platelets in the entangled matrix.
']], ['Dynamic mechanical analysis', ['The dynamic mechanical properties of PU/GO and PU/mGO nanocomposites are presented in [f0025] as plots of <i>E</i>′, <i>E</i>″ and tan delta against temperature.
 From [f0025]a it is clear that the storage modulus (<i>E</i>′) of all nanocomposites (modified and unmodified) is higher than that of neat PU.
 The loss modulus also follows the same trend indicating a larger amount of energy dissipation for PU/mGO samples as compared to PU/GO ([f0025]b). The temperature that corresponds to the maximum value of tan <i>δ</i> provides an estimation of the glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>g) of the samples.
 However, with increasing temperature, chain motion is facilitated [b0090]. This is the reason why the tan <i>δ</i> values decrease with temperature ([f0025]c). Also, the increase in <i>T</i>g can be related to the degree of homogeneous dispersion of the filler in the matrix and the filler–polymer interactions [b0090]. The high <i>E</i>′ value for PMG3 in the glassy region confirms the presence of highly dispersed mGOs in the PU nanocomposites as evidenced from the SEM analysis.
 In case of strain sweep characterizations, these models are mainly based on the concepts of change in microstructure of the composites upon filler cluster breakdown and the reagglomeration – deformation mechanism [b0095]. In 2002, Heinrich and Klüppel [b0100] reviewed all such models for the amplitude dependence of the dynamic viscoelastic properties of reinforced elastomers.
 In the case of elastomer samples, structural variations of the entanglements at the filler–polymer interface can also take place and cause additional energy dissipation [b0105].', 'In nanocomposites polymer chains are adsorbed on the filler surface resulting in a core–shell structure, the core being the packed particle cluster and the shell being immobilized polymer chains having different mobility as compared to the bulk.
 But when the strain amplitude in dynamic experiments is gradually increased, a critical value of this amplitude will cause breakdown processes to occur in the agglomerates in elastomer composites [b0095]. This causes a decrease in the storage modulus (<i>G</i>′). This ‘Payne Effect’ is explained by Kraus, Huber and Vilgis, and Maier and Goritz [b0110] by means of phenomenological models based on different types of molecular interactions occurring within the system.
 The Kraus model for nanocomposites with strong filler–filler interactions [b0115] provides the following relations (Eqs.
 [e0010 e0015]) for the dynamic modulus as a function of strain amplitude.

The constant <i>γ</i>c is the strain amplitude belonging to the maximum   G  (m)  ″   of the loss modulus.
   G  (∞)  ′   becomes equal to <i>G</i>′(<i>γ</i>) for very large strains and   G  0  ′   equals <i>G</i>′(<i>γ</i>) at very low strains.
 <i>γ</i>c is a characteristic shear strain amplitude and <i>m</i> is a fitting parameter related to the filler agglomerate structure [b0100] and is independent of the filler content and dispersion.
', 'The dynamic viscoelastic response of neat PU and nanocomposites containing GOs or mGOs at a constant frequency of 0.5Hz are plotted as a function of strain in [f0030]. The Kraus model is applied to the Payne effect observed for all PU/GO and mGO nanocomposites as shown in [f0030]a.
 The fitting parameters of the experimental data are given in [t0005]. The m value varies between 0.4 and 0.6 depending on the filler concentration and aggregation and thus dispersion [b0100]. The parameter m is around 0.43 for the neat PU and increases with GO incorporation which indicates the increase in filler aggregates within the system.
 At the highest concentration of 3wt%, PU/mGO has an m value of 0.53 whereas for PU/GO m is 0.56. This is attributed to the better dispersion of the mGO nanosheets in the PU matrix by stronger interactions through MDI molecules.
 When polymer–filler interactions dominate, the non-linear viscoelasticity of elastomer composites originates from variations in the topological constraint density at the filler–polymer interface [b0100], as described by the model of Maier and Goritz [b0110] in [f0030]b.

', 'The experimental results of <i>G</i>′ obtained for all composites are fitted with the Maier and Goritz model as well ([f0030]b). Fitting with the Maier and Goritz model provides a better understanding of the filler–polymer interactions [b0120 b0125]. The dotted lines represent the curve fits.
 [e0020] are given in [t0005] which demonstrates the effect of the filler concentration and filler–polymer interactions on the modulus variation.
', 'The cross link density values given in [t0005] can assist in providing a quantitative estimation of the matrix filler interactions.
 There is a significant crosslink density difference between the neat PU and PU nanocomposites at different filler loadings [b0070]. The higher N value of PMG3 (<i>N</i>total=0.27×1026/cm3) as compared to PG3 (<i>N</i>total=0.16×1026/cm3) can be explained by the high confinement effect due to the good filler dispersion and effective interaction between mGOs and PU.
 Both values are much higher than the neat PU (<i>N</i>total=0.01×1026/cm3) case indicating the efficiency of GO nanosheets in reinforcing the polymer.
 The variation in loss modulus ([f0030]c) with respect to strain is also shown.
 This movement of electrons causes the phenomenon of electric conduction and is the basis of the well-known filler–polymer network theory [b0130]. At low GO concentration, the composites already show significant improvements in properties as compared to the unfilled PU, which is due to the large filler–polymer interfacial interaction giving rise to network formation.
 The dielectric constant of the composites depends on the filler volume fraction since the tunneling of charges takes place through the gaps between filler surfaces [b0135]. At higher concentrations of the filler, the distance between the aggregates reduces and the gap between the particle aggregates controls the charge transfer between filler aggregates.
 The sharper increase in both dielectric and rheological properties of PMG3 can be explained on the basis of this point.
