Facile synthesis of waterborne UV-curable polyurethane/silica nanocomposites and morphology, physical properties of its nanostructured filmsWaterborne UV-curable polyurethane (WUPU)/silica nanocomposites were prepared by in situ method using aqueous silica sol. the nanosilica particles were well dispersed in the matrix. Some large silica aggregates in the magnitude of micrometer can be seen with increasing the silica content.['Waterborne polyurethane (WPU) dispersions have been widely used in many applications such as coatings, adhesives and thermoplastic elastomers because of their zero/low volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [bib0005 bib0010]. Their films show an excellent elasticity and toughness.
 But the mechanical strength and stiffness of these films is typically inferior to most solvent based PU crosslinked films.
 Several attempts have been made to enhance the performance of the WPU including hybrid dispersions [bib0015 bib0020], crosslinkable dispersions [bib0025 bib0030 bib0035] and nanocomposite dispersions [bib0040 bib0045 bib0050 bib0055 bib0060 bib0065 bib0070 bib0075 bib0080 bib0085 bib0090 bib0095 bib0100 bib0105 bib0110 bib0115]. Among these methods, incorporation of nanosized inorganic fillers into polyurethane dispersions to form nanostructured films has become an effective strategy to enhance properties of WPU.
 WPU nanocomposites containing nanoscale fillers, such as silica [bib0040 bib0045 bib0050 bib0055 bib0060], clay [bib0065 bib0070 bib0075 bib0080], polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) [bib0085 bib0090], carbon nanotube [bib0095 bib0100], cellulose nanocrystals [bib0105 bib0110 bib0115] have pronounced properties that are not realized with traditional microscale fillers.
 Among the various inorganic nanosized fillers, silica nanoparticles have many advantages, including high hardness and relatively low refractive index, commercial availability from different sources: sols of nanosilica as colloid dispersions in water or organic solvents.
 In addition, silica has silanol group on the surface, which may interact with the hard and/or soft segments of polyurethane, thereby aiding dispersion of the silica nanoparticles in the polyurethane matrix [bib0120]. So nanosilica is expected to offer attractive potential in WPU reinforcement.
', 'However, most of the polyurethane/silica nanocomposites were prepared in organic solvents by mixing polyol with colloidal silica sol with subsequent reaction with diisocyanate [bib0120 bib0125 bib0130 bib0135 bib0140]. Only a few WPU/silica nanocomposites were reported in the literature [bib0040 bib0045 bib0050 bib0055 bib0060], which were prepared by physically blending method [bib0040] or in situ method [bib0045 bib0050 bib0055 bib0060]. The blending method is simply by mixing polyurethane dispersions with aqueous silica sol. the polyurethane and silica nanoparticles are hard to homogeneously blend on high levels of nanoscale mixing.
 When applying in situ method, the fumed silica can be incorporated during polyurethane acrylate prepolymer synthesis process or the silica clusters can be incorporated by the general sol–gel process.
 Aqueous colloidal silica is nanosized silica dispersed in water with well-defined, perfectly round shape.
 It can be used to produce polymer/silica colloidal nanocomposites [bib0145]. But the diisocyanate monomer is more sensitive to water.
 So at present, to the best of our knowledge, there is no research on the synthesis of waterborne WUPU/silica nanocomposites using aqueous silica sol. In this paper, we introduced a facile approach for the synthesis of the novel WUPU/silica nanocomposites using aqueous silica sol. The effects of silica nanoparticles on the colloidal dispersions as well as the morphology and physical properties of the nanostructured films were investigated.
'].
 We have overcome these difficulties by the application of a facile approach for the synthesis of WUPU/silica nanocomposites using aqueous silica sol (as shown in [fig0050]). In a first set of experiments, aqueous silica sol was added during the process of the neutralizing PUA prepolymers.
 A stable WUPU/silica dispersion was also obtained, but its hybrid film was not transparent and some white silica powders were observed at the surface of hybrid films, suggesting that the silica nanoparticles were seriously aggregated in the hybrid films (see [fig0005]WUPU/silica-10). So these contrast experiments showed that incorporation of aqueous silica sol by this method offers a decisive advantage over simple admixtures of preformed WUPU dispersions and aqueous silica sol. This can be explained as follows: the high viscosity of the neutralized PUA prepolymers enables the polyurethane chain adsorb at the surface of silica particles and the possibility of the interactions mainly exist between the O atoms in the PEG chain and the H atoms of the silanol groups as well as between CO groups of urethane/urea (hard segment) and Si–OH on silica [bib0150 bib0155], while low viscosity of polyurethane dispersions makes the polyurethane chain hardly adsorb at the surface of nanosilica particles.
 In addition, The WPU dispersions are electrostatically stabilized with –COO– ions of neutralized DMPA, while their counterions NH+(C2H5)3 locate in the neighborhood.
 Therefore, a stable electrical double layer is formed at the surface of each WUPU particle, which also makes adsorption at the surface of silica nanoparticles great difficult at a basic pH>7.', 'The incorporation of the silica nanoparticles has a major impact on the colloidal properties of the polyurethane dispersions relative to the control sample.
 The intensity average particle diameters of the WUPU dispersions and silica sol are 217 and 7nm respectively.
 The intensity average particle diameters of WUPU/silica dispersion with silica contents of 5, 10 and 15wt% are 284, 478 and 490nm, respectively (as shown in [fig0010] and [tbl0010]). One reason for the increase of average particle diameter with increasing of silica nanoparticles content is probably due to the inclusion of silica nanoparticles within WUPU particle, which has been proved in waterborne silica nanocomposites using the phase-inversion-emulsification technique [bib0160 bib0165 bib0170]. In addition, the polyurethane chain containing PEG soft segments can adsorb at the silica surface and encapsulate the silica particles.
 While the particle diameters of the physically blending WUPU/silica dispersions with silica content 10wt% is about 245nm and much lower than that of the corresponding WUPU/silica composite dispersions (478nm), indicating that most free silica particles exist in physically blending dispersions.
', '[fig0015] shows the variation of the dispersion viscosity as a function of the shear rate for WUPU/silica dispersions.
 For WUPU-Silica-10 dispersion, its viscosity are lower than that of the physically blending dispersion (WUPU/Silica-10), which indicates polyurethane chain adsorb at the surface of silica particles and reduce the effective volume due to higher particle size as shown in [fig0010].']], ['Morphology and structure of the WUPU/silica nanocomposite films', ['X-ray diffraction analyses of the WUPU/silica nanostructured films are shown in [fig0020]. For pure WUPU films, a broad diffraction halo is seen near 2<i>θ</i>=20°, this diffraction halo is associated with the amorphous phase of PU [bib0160]. The nanosilica does not display any crystalline peaks, which is consistent with the silica nanoparticles being noncrystalline at that size scale.
 Some representative micrographs of samples with 0, 5, 10, and 15wt% are shown in [fig0025]. A smooth WPU film is observed in [fig0025](a). In the cases of 5, 10wt% silica content, the silica nanoparticles were well dispersed in the PU matrix, implying strong interaction between polyurethanes and silica nanoparticles (see [fig0025](b) and (c)). But for the hybrid films with 15wt% silica content, the field appears pretty crowded with silica particles.
 Some large silica aggregates in the magnitude of micrometer can be seen (see [fig0025](d)), which arises from the aggregation among free silica particles.
', 'AFM measurements have been proved to be an important tool to identify the fine structure of the polyurethane nanocomposites surface morphology [bib0175 bib0180]. A tapping mode is used to image topographic features and the spatial variation in surface by height and phase imaging.
 [fig0030] shows the AFM topographic and phase images of the WUPU/silica nanocomposite films.
 For the pure WUPU films, the root-mean-square rms roughness was below 1nm, indicating that the film surface was smooth.
 The size of these domains was improved with increasing the silica content as shown in [fig0030]b, c and d height image.
 But the rms roughness of hybrid films was not much affected by the silica content and lies in a range of 40–50nm.
 The image for the hybrid films with 5% silica reveals the presence of brighter and darker domains.
 The image for the sample with 10wt% silica shows a less clear phase contrast compared with hybrid films with 5wt% silica.
 Furthermore, when the WUPU/silica film with 15wt% silica, the signs of silica-rich and polyurethane-rich phase disappear and showed obviously protruded domains, which may result from silica aggregation and embodied at the surface of the hybrid films.
']], ['Mechanical properties of the WUPU/silica nanocomposite films', ['The viscoelastic characteristics of the WUPU/silica nanocomposites were evaluated by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to obtain the information of crosslink density and the glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>g). The crosslink density of the films was calculated with the following equation [bib0185]. E   ′=3   ν   eRT  where <i>ν</i>e is the number of moles of elastically effective chains per cubic centimeter of the film.
 Data for the nanocomposites films is shown in [tbl0015] and [fig0035]. The storage modulus values of the nanocomposites films are higher than that of neat WUPU films at the rubbery plateau as shown in [fig0035].', 'It can be observed that as the silica is incorporated into the WUPU films, the increase in the storage modulus and effective cross-link density occurs.
 The results suggest that the presence of nanosilica can facilitate cross-linking reaction and thereby cross-link density is increased [bib0190]. In addition, the adsorption of polyurethane chains onto the surface of silica particles can also result in a rise in the effective degree of cross-linking [bib0195]. So the silica can act as physical cross-linker.
 But At 15wt% of silica content, the storage modulus and the crosslink density decrease due to silica coagulation (as measured in SEM, AFM), In this case, the silica particles aggregated and embedded into the polymer matrix, increasing the system heterogeneity and leading to a decrease in the crosslink density and the storage modulus.
 [fig0040] depicts two damping (transition) peaks for the WUPU films.
 This was due to the interfacial interaction between the PU and silica nanoparticles [bib0200]. The loss tangent of hybrid films is highest with the 15wt% silica (tan<i>δ</i>max=1.23). While the loss tangent of hybrid films with 5, 10wt% silica is close to the pure polyurethane films (tan<i>δ</i>max=1.0). So elastic behavior of hybrid films is not much affected by the incorporation of 5, 10wt% silica.
', "Stress–strain curves for the WUPU/silica films with different silica contents are shown in [fig0045]. The corresponding mechanical properties, namely Young's modulus, the tensile strength, and the tensile elongation of the nanocomposites, are summarized in [tbl0020]. All the samples behaved as weak elastomers and their stress–strain curves were similar to theoretical ones for a Gaussian-type network, without a yield point.
 Upon addition of nanosilica to the WUPU matrix, Young's modulus increased from 1.1 to 2.1GPa at 10% silica content.
 To our surprise, the elongation experienced no loss at all, and it even increased to a certain extent and exhibits an improvement in elasticity as shown in [fig0045]. This enhancement of mechanical properties may result from interfacial interaction between silica and the WUPU matrix resulting from hydrogen bonding interaction.
 In addition, this interaction may be able to alter the static (or strained) microphase morphology of the WUPU in such a way that results in improved mechanical properties [bib0205]. Such an alteration to the microphase morphology may be critically dependent upon the amount of the silica (as measured in AFM). For the nanocomposites with 10wt% silica, a 62% enhancement in tensile strength and 47% enhancement in elongation.
 But when silica is 15wt%, the tensile strength and elongation properties of the nanocomposite decrease.
