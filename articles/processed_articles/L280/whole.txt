The effect of silica nanoparticles on the morphology, mechanical properties and thermal degradation kinetics of PMMASilica–PMMA nanocomposites with different silica quantities were prepared by a melt compounding method. The effect of silica amount, in the range 1–5wt.%, on the morphology, mechanical properties and thermal degradation kinetics of PMMA was investigated by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C{1H} CP-MAS NMR) and measures of proton spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (<i>T</i>

                     (<i>H</i>)), in the laboratory frame (<i>T</i>
                     1(<i>H</i>)) and cross-polarization times (<i>T</i>
                     CH). Results showed that silica nanoparticles are well dispersed in the polymeric matrix whose structure remains amorphous. The degradation of the polymer occurs at higher temperature in the presence of silica because of the interaction between the two components.['The use of inorganic nanoparticles as additives to improve polymer performance has received industrial and academic interest in recent years.
 Among the nanocomposite materials, one of the most widely studied is silica-poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) because of its optical and mechanical properties [bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5]. In fact, the silica nanoparticles incorporated into the polymer matrix can improve the strength, the abrasion-resistance and the aging-resistance of the polymer.
 The nanocomposite properties are strongly dependent on “molecular” properties, and in particular on the nature and dimensions of the organic–inorganic interfaces, on the mechanisms of interaction between the organic and inorganic components, and on the structural and dynamic properties of either the organic or inorganic phases.
 However, the incomplete condensation and poor thermal stability of PMMA has a negative influence on the optical and thermal properties of the composites, even if properties like the surface hardness increases with an increase in the amount of silica [bib4].', 'Several methods have been used to prepare nanocomposites: solution mixing, physical mixing, <i>in</i>  <i>situ</i> polymerization and single-screw extrusion [bib6 bib7 bib8]. Ma et\xa0al. [bib9] prepared polyacrylate–silica nanocomposites by a sol–gel process <i>via in situ</i> emulsion polymerization.
 Yu et\xa0al. [bib10] synthesized surface-modified silica particles and copolymerized the obtained nanoparticles with MMA monomers.
 Freris et\xa0al. [bib11] performed the polymer encapsulation of submicrometer-sized silica particles by the synthesis of the polymer shell, poly(methyl methacrylate), under static conditions in a reaction medium free of surfactants and stabilizing agents.
 Preparation of SiO2–PMMA nanocomposites <i>via in situ</i> emulsion polymerization in the presence of an initiator was investigated [bib3 bib12 bib13 bib14]. It was found that the presence of silica retarded the thermal decomposition of the polymer chains, which was related to the large silica surface area, to radicals probably trapped by silica during degradation and to uncondensed residue of the precursor which needed a large amount of heat to decompose.
 The storage and loss modulus, glass transition temperature (<i>T</i> <i>g</i> ) and activation energy of all the composites increased with the amount of silica.
 An increase in the thermal stability and activation energy with chain length of the organic molecules was observed when organically modified silica was used [bib3]. However, the opposite trend where the presence of silica in PMMA did not enhance the thermal stability was also observed [bib15 bib16]. Some authors, studying the thermal degradation kinetics, have reported that the addition of silica could also lead to a decreased activation energy of degradation [bib17].', 'An improvement in thermal stability with an increase in silica content was observed in silica–PMMA nanocomposites prepared by using single-screw extrusion [bib18 bib19]. The nanocomposites showed significant improvement in the mechanical performance and thermal stabilities, although they were not strictly flame retardant when subjected to fire tests like limiting oxygen index or horizontal Bunsen burner tests.
', 'The purpose of this study was to prepare silica–PMMA nanocomposites through a melt compounding method by using chemically modified SiO2 nanoparticles.
 Both nanoparticles and composites were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) thermogravimetric analyses (TGA), FTIR spectroscopy and 13C cross-polarization magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (13C{1H} CP-MAS NMR) and measures of proton spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (<i>T</i> 1<i>ρ</i> (<i>H</i>)), in the laboratory frame (<i>T</i> 1(<i>H</i>)) and cross-polarization times (<i>T</i> CH). The effect of the presence and amount of silica nanoparticles on the thermal and mechanical properties and on thermal degradation kinetics of the PMMA will be discussed.

['The TEM micrographs of the SiO2 powder are shown in [fig1] .', 'Aggregates of size between 1 and 3μm and composed by a large number of nanoparticles (more than 500) of rounded morphology are observed.
 The histogram, also shown in [fig1], was obtained after analyzing several micrographs and depicts a relatively uniform and narrow particle size distribution which mean size is 20nm.

 Above the glass transition temperature the 1 and 2% silica containing nanocomposites still have storage moduli below that of PMMA, but the 5% containing nanocomposite has higher storage modulus values.
 The loss modulus of the composites, shown in [fig3]B, follows the same trend as the storage modulus.
 In this case, however, the glass transition temperatures for both the 2% and 5% silica containing composites are higher than that of pure PMMA, indicating that effective immobilization already starts when 2% nanoparticles are introduced into the polymer.
 The tan <i>δ</i> curves, shown in [fig3]C, confirm the observation from the loss modulus curves.

Vyazovkin et\xa0al. [bib27] recommend the KAS method for accuracy of activation energy values.

%) at heating rates of 3, 5, 7 and 9°Cmin−1 the isoconversional graphs of ln<i>β versus</i> 1/<i>T</i> according to Equation [fd1] were plotted ([fig5 fig6]  ), as well as ln(<i>β</i>/<i>T</i> 2) <i>versus</i> 1/<i>T</i> according to Equation [fd2] ([fig7 fig8]  ).', 'The activation energy values were calculated from the slopes of the isoconversional plots.

 Similar results were found in other studies, but the observed trends were not clearly explained by the authors [bib28 bib29]. However, Vyazovkin et\xa0al. [bib27 bib28 bib29 bib30 bib31] related the dependence of activation energy on degree of conversion to competing reactions in the degradation process.
 In the presence of silica, certain intermediates are apparently formed with increasing <i>α</i>, that decompose first and require a lower <i>E</i> <i>a</i> .', 'TGA-FTIR analyses were done to establish the nature of the degradation product(s), and to confirm the observations from the kinetic analysis of the thermal degradation process of PMMA and silica–PMMA (5wt.

No new peaks or peak shifts were observed for the nanocomposite samples.

 To gain insight into the organization of the polymer molecules in contact with the nanoparticle surface, 13C{1H} CP-MAS NMR experiments were performed.
 The 13C{1H} CP-MAS NMR spectra of PMMA and of the silica–PMMA (5wt.

', 'The <i>T</i> 1<i>ρ</i>  is sensitive to molecular motions which occur in the kHz region.
 Larger <i>T</i> 1<i>ρ</i>  values result in an increase in polymer rigidity.
 A homogeneous <i>T</i> 1<i>ρ</i>  <i>H</i> increase was observed for the silica–PMMA composite, suggesting an increase of the polymer stiffness and that the silica is well dispersed into the PMMA matrix, thus confirming that the filler has an observable effect on the polymer chain mobility.
', 'The <i>T</i> CH value decrease for the signal at 178ppm indicates that there is an increase in the heteronuclear dipolar interactions between the carbonyl carbon and the surrounding hydrogen nuclei.
