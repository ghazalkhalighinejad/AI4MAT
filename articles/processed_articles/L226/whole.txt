Epoxy/graphene platelets nanocomposites with two levels of interface strengthGraphene platelets (GP) are a novel class of nanofillers due to its good compatibility with most polymers, high aspect ratio, high absolute strength and cost-effectiveness. We in this study synthesised two types of epoxy/GP nanocomposites with different interface strength using the combination of sonication and chemical modification. Although the surface-modified graphene platelets (<i>m</i>-GP) formed clusters, a higher degree of dispersion and exfoliation of graphene was observed in each cluster owning to the improved interface by modification. The scrolling of graphene was found predominantly in the interface-modified nanocomposite. At 4 wt%, the modified nanocomposite shows fracture energy release rate <i>G</i>1c
                      613.4 J m−2, while the unmodified nanocomposite indicates 417.3 J m−2, in comparison with neat epoxy <i>G</i>1c
                      204.2 J m−2. The interface modification enhanced the glass transition temperature of neat epoxy from 94.7 to 108.6 °C, 14.7% increment. Toughening mechanisms are attributed to the voiding, microcracking and breakage of GP, while matrix may not consume as much fracture energy as <i>m</i>-GP do.['Polymers are well known for their high specific strength and flexibility.
 However, many polymers, e.
g.
 rubbers and thermoset resins, have either low absolute strength or poor fracture toughness, limiting their applications across industries.
 To remedy these shortcomings, polymers are often compounded with a variety of fillers including carbon black, carbon nanotubes, clay, silica and polymeric particles; of these, carbon-based fillers are of great significance in scientific research and product development—carbon black is a major type of fillers in rubber industry and carbon nanotubes have been extensively studied for the past decades.
 Despite the research of carbon nanotubes, it has not yet reached a situation where carbon nanotubes are ideal for reinforcing or toughening polymers, because of expensive manufacturing costs (such as single wall carbon nanotubes), high viscosity caused by the “bird’s nest” structure of the entangled tubes, and high anisotropic functionality.
 By contrast, graphene platelets (GP) are a new class of filler comprising one or more layers of a graphene plane which is of exceptional functionalities, high mechanical strength (1\xa0TPa in Young’s modulus and 130\xa0GPa in ultimate strength) and chemical stability, for the following reasons: their abundance in nature and thus their cost-effectiveness; their extremely high specific surface area, which carries higher levels of transferring stress across interface and provides higher reinforcement [bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8] than carbon nanotubes; their isotropic electrical/thermal conductivities on the graphene plane; their low viscosity when compounded with polymer; and their non-toxicity.
 Although GP can be produced from thermal shock at over 500\xa0°C, we will fabricate GP by sonication in this study.
', 'Epoxy resins are widely used as adhesives, coatings, structural materials and compositae matrix.
 However, epoxy resins are inherently brittle, which makes them vulnerable to micro-cracks produced in service, and this limits their applications.
 Extensive studies have thus been conducted to toughen epoxy resins using rubbers, thermoplastics, inorganic particles etc.
 Rubber and thermoplastic toughening methods require a substantial amount of toughener, e.
g.
 15–20\xa0wt%, which causes loss of other desirable properties.
 Polymers containing layered silicate nanofillers have shown the greatest mechanical and barrier properties, and attracted the most extensive research and development due to the fillers’ high specific surface area, functionality and cost-effective fabrication.
 Unfortunately, the silicate has proved not highly effective in toughening epoxy due to the weak interface between silicon-based layers and carbon-based resins [bib9 bib10 bib11 bib12].', 'GP consisting of carbon atoms are more compatible with epoxy resins and thus produce a stronger interface than the silicate.
 Yasmin prepared epoxy/graphite nanocomposites by mixing epoxy with graphite in solvent; 4\xa0wt% graphite increases Young’s modulus by 10% and glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>g ) from 143 to 145\xa0°C [bib13]. When the mixing process was promoted by sonication and shear mixing, 1\xa0wt% GP increase modulus 15%, but this is accompanied by a reduction of tensile strength [bib14]. Koratkar et al. very recently investigated the mechanical properties of epoxy/GP nanocomposites prepared by a similar approach.
 The epoxy fracture toughness was improved from 0.97 to 1.48\xa0MPa\xa0m1/2 at 0.1\xa0wt% filler fraction, and the toughening mechanism was attributed to crack deflection by thin GP.
 Unfortunately, no data were available at higher filler fractions [bib15]. Interface plays a vital role in determining the mechanical and thermal properties of nanocomposites.
 Li and Kim employed UV/O3 to oxidise GP to create an improved interface between platelets and epoxy.
 The resulting nanocomposites showed a steady increase of <i>T</i>g  and modulus with prolonging the UV/O3 treatment [bib16]. Miller presented a new approach to the functionalisation of GP by using a coupling agent which built covalent bonding between fillers and soft matrix (0.78\xa0GPa Young’s modulus), resulting in 50% modulus improvement at 1\xa0wt% filler fraction [bib17]; a similar approach was reported by Chiang and Hsu to improve the flame-retardant performance of epoxy/GP nanocomposite [bib18].', 'In spite of these studies, it is not clear the effect of interface strength on the structure and properties, in particular the fracture toughness and toughening mechanisms of these materials.
 Therefore, this study will synthesise two types of epoxy/GP nanocomposites with different interface strength through the combination of sonication and chemical modification to investigate the effect of interface on the structure and properties of the nanocomposites.

[['Effect of sonication temperature on graphite suspension', ['Since Yasmin employed an ultrasonic bath to disperse graphite in solvent [bib14], sonication has become an indispensable method to the fabrication of polymer/graphite nanocomposites.
 The sonication time 1.5–8\xa0h was reported for the nanocomposites [bib14 bib15 bib16], but it is not clear whether there is a significant effect of temperature on the dispersion of graphite in solvent.
 Therefore, this study dispersed two batches of graphite in acetone using sonication of 30\xa0min at two temperatures 15\xa0°C and 50\xa0°C, respectively.
 [fig2] shows the dispersion state of these two batches 60\xa0min after sonication.
 No obvious precipitate is found for the batch sonicated at 15\xa0°C in [fig2]a.
 By contrast, nearly transparent suspension was observed for the batch sonicated at 50\xa0°C ([fig2]b). Not shown here is that the sonication time longer than 30\xa0min made no obvious improvement for the suspension.
']], ['FTIR', ['[fig3] contains FTIR spectra of raw graphite, GP and <i>m</i>-GP.
 Obvious absorption bands found in [fig3] for raw graphite include (1) an absorption at 2327\xa0cm−1 and a band between 3304 and 3500\xa0cm−1, corresponding to the presence of –OH group; (2) absorption at 1043 and 1144\xa0cm−1 relating to the presence of –SO group; and (3) absorption at 1650 and 873\xa0cm−1 caused by the stretching vibration of –CO and –C–O–, implying the existence of carboxyl group.
 Two absorption bands at 2348\xa0cm−1 and 3304–3500\xa0cm−1 can be distinguished, implying the presence of –OH groups.
 After GP were modified by 4,4′-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), the absorption intensity at 3304 and 3500\xa0cm−1 was further reduced and the absorption at 2348\xa0cm−1 was shifted to low wave number, and this means that the –OH groups was consumed by the modification; two new absorption peaks appear: one at 2272\xa0cm−1 corresponding to the isocyanate –NCO stretching and another at 1530\xa0cm−1 relating to the vibration of CNH groups [bib21 bib22 bib23]. In conclusion, MDI was grafted to GP through the modification.
']], ['X-ray diffractometry', ['[fig4] contains WAXD patterns of raw graphite, GP, <i>m</i>-GP and their 4\xa0wt% nanocomposites.
 A sharp peak at 2<i>θ</i> of 26.38° was observed for GP, corresponding to a d-spacing of 0.337\xa0nm; this is caused by the removal of intercalates during purification.
 Actually, the –OH groups of GP reacted with MDI during the modification as analysed in Section [sec3.2], which reduced the regularity of the stacked layers, thus broadening the diffraction of GP.
 The <i>m</i>-GP nanocomposite shows a more broadened peak with a small shoulder as circled in [fig4]; this implies that the modification facilitated the interaction of matrix molecules into the layer spacing of GP.
 The intercalated matrix molecules—DEGBA and hardener J230—reacted with the grafted MDI as shown in [fig5]. Since these reactions are well known [bib23 bib24 bib25], no characterisation is made herein.
 [fig6] contains micrographs of the 4\xa0wt% epoxy/GP nanocomposite.
 Micron-sized clusters are observed in [fig6]a.
 When magnified in [fig6]b, a cluster is found consisting of graphene platelets which contain a few exfoliated graphene layers as indicated by black arrows; this means that graphite exists in the form of GP in the nanocomposites.
 [fig6]c provides information: coexistence of intercalation as shown by white arrows and exfoliation by black arrows, and the wrinkling of graphene layers as circled.
 The coexistence is confirmed in [fig6]d, which also indicates a rolled structure of graphene as shown in a circle.
 The thinner the platelets, the more scrolls (resemble a small diameter single-walled carbon nanotubes [bib26 bib27]) created.
', 'The morphology of the 4\xa0wt% epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP nanocomposite is shown in [fig7]. In comparison with epoxy/GP nanocomposite, clusters appear less in quantity but larger in size, as demonstrated by a few typical clusters in [fig7]a.
 Image analysis shows 1.8\xa0±\xa01.5μm for the clusters’ size in [fig7]a in comparison with 0.7\xa0±\xa00.5\xa0μm for those in [fig6]a.
 When a cluster is magnified in [fig7]b and c, rolling is found predominantly, as shown in the circles.
 Rolling is further confirmed in [fig7]d.
', 'Comparing [fig6] with [fig7] leads to a conclusion that GP exfoliated better in epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP nanocomposite.
 After GP were grafted with 4,4′-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), these platelets reacted with matrix molecules during curing; the reactions separated GP into thinner ones or exfoliated them completely as indicated by the increased number of graphene layers in [fig7]. These thinner or exfoliated GP were able to scroll more readily to reduce configurational entropy during curing, leading to more scrolls in [fig7].']], ['Mechanical properties and fracture toughness', ['Of all types of fillers, silicate layers have shown the greatest reinforcing effect for many polymers, and attracted the most extensive research and development due to the fillers’ high specific surface area, functionality and cost-effective fabrication [bib3 bib4 bib28]. However, silicate layers cannot toughen epoxy effectively and this is probably caused by its silicon-based composition and the low surface grafting density.
', '[fig8] shows the Young’s modulus and tensile strength of neat epoxy and its nanocomposites at 1–5.5\xa0wt%. Epoxy/GP nanocomposites show a more prominent increase in modulus at 1–2.5\xa0wt% but the stiffening effect diminishes nearly at 4\xa0wt%, while the epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP increases steadily the modulus up to 4\xa0wt% and drops slightly at 5.5\xa0wt%. At 4\xa0wt% <i>m</i>-GP increase the modulus of neat epoxy from 2.69 to 3.27\xa0GPa, 21.6% increment.
 At the same fraction, GP increase the modulus to 2.89\xa0GPa, 7.4%. Although both nanocomposites show a reduction of tensile strength, the epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP indicates less reduction at 4\xa0wt%. Overall, interface modification makes little impact on the tensile properties of these nanocomposites.
', 'The plane-strain fracture toughness <i>K</i>1c and critical strain energy release rate <i>G</i>1c are graphically shown in [fig9]. Epoxy/GP nanocomposites show more increase in both properties at low fractions only, while the modified nanocomposites indicate continuous increase until 5.5\xa0wt%. At 4\xa0wt% <i>m</i>-GP, the <i>G</i>1c of neat epoxy increases from 204.2 to 613.4\xa0J\xa0m−2, 200% increment; by contrast, the same fraction of GP improves the <i>G</i>1c to 417.3\xa0J\xa0m−2, merely 104.3% increment.
', 'It is worth to note that GP increase Young’s modulus and fracture toughness at low fractions 1–2.5\xa0wt% and then these properties reduce dramatically.
 These molecules bridged with matrix molecules, locking GP inside clusters; this increased the cluster size while reducing the cluster number, as supported by the\xa0comparison of [fig6 fig7]. The modification resulted in the following: (i) bridging GP with matrix molecules for a high interface strength; (ii) promoting exfoliation; and (iii) increasing the cluster size while reducing the cluster number.
 It means that GP create a higher stiffening and toughening effect at low fractions 0–2.5\xa0wt% due to its higher cluster numbers than <i>m</i>-GP; at 4\xa0wt%, the effect diminishes because the interface of clusters is not good and more clusters mean more regions of weak interface.
 By contrast, 4\xa0wt% <i>m</i>-GP provide a significant toughening effect due to its high interface strength.
', 'The toughness improvement by <i>m</i>-GP surpasses previous efforts in toughening epoxy using silicate layers [bib29 bib30 bib31 bib32]. Although GP have similar layered structures to silicate layers, they are more effective to achieve prominent reinforcing or toughening effects, because the platelets which consist of graphene of 0.34\xa0nm in thickness and ∼1\xa0μ in lateral dimensions, are more compatible with hydrophobic polymer matrix than silicate layers.
', 'Most thermoplastics are well known for high fracture toughness, such as poly (ethylene terephthalate), poly (ether-ether-ketone) [bib33] and polychlorotrifluoroethylene [bib34], but these materials cannot be used in many applications such as compositae matrix, coating and adhesives.
 The same pros and cons incurred for microcapsule-toughened epoxy [bib35]. Nanoparticles-toughened resins avoid these disadvantages [bib29 bib36 bib37 bib38 bib39], due to their much smaller particle–particle distance and much larger total particle surface area [see Fig.
\xa03 and Table 3 in Ref.
 [bib37] than their peer micron-sized particles.
 Although these nanotoughened resins have not shown more reinforcing effect than fibre laminate, a research shows that nanoclay-toughened polymer, when used as a matrix, promotes the stiffening and strengthening effect of fibres [bib40]. This implies that nanotoughened resins will replace conventional micron-sized toughened resins when these nanotoughened resins are sufficiently cost-effective.
 Although a great many studies reported on the increased <i>T</i>g of epoxy using sheet-like nanoclays [bib41 bib42 bib43], the effect of interface strength on the thermal property of polymer/GP nanocomposites remains unknown.
', '[fig10 fig11] show the tan delta curves as a function of temperature for neat epoxy, epoxy/GP and epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP nanocomposites.
', 'As summarised in [tbl1], the neat epoxy <i>T</i>g increases 8.1% to 102.4\xa0°C at 2.5\xa0wt%; the <i>T</i>gs of epoxy/GP are lower than those of epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP nanocomposites at each fraction; at 2.5\xa0wt%, the neat epoxy <i>T</i>g rises up 14.7% to 108.6\xa0°C.
 When <i>m</i>-GP increase to 4\xa0wt%, the <i>T</i>g slightly reduces to 106.4\xa0°C, and this value remains similar at 5.5\xa0wt%. This is probably caused by two reasons (i) particle agglomeration when fillers content reached a saturation threshold.
 The <i>T</i>g improvement caused by interface modification is in agreement with our previous research [bib6 bib29 bib36 bib37 bib44].']], ['Fractography', ['The fracture surface of compact tension (CT) specimen provides critical information to identify fracture mechanisms for polymer nanocomposites.
 Since neat epoxy shows smooth, featureless fracture surface [bib36], its SEM micrographs are not shown here.
 [fig12] contains the CT fracture surface of the 4\xa0wt% epoxy/GP nanocomposite.
 A stress-whitened zone of ∼5\xa0mm in height is found in front of the crack tip in [fig12]a; a typical region is magnified in [fig12]b, which indicates a few clusters as shown by white arrows, corresponding to the clusters observed in [fig6]a; fracture phenomena shown in [fig12]c include voids and layer breakage as indicated by circles; [fig12]d demonstrates a number of cracks.
 In [fig13]a, the stress-whitened zone for epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP nanocomposite is as high as ∼11\xa0mm, over 50% increment of the zone for the epoxy/GP; this may indicate that the size-increased zone is able to consume more energy when fracture occurs, corresponding to a higher fracture toughness in [fig9]. Two features are shown in [fig13]b: a trench and clusters as indicated by black arrows and white arrows, respectively.
 Trenches are more popular for epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP nanocomposite in [fig13] than for the epoxy/GP in [fig12]; the appearance of trenches indicates a higher degree of surface deformation which consumes more fracture energy.
 The clusters in [fig13]b appear larger than those of the epoxy/GP in [fig12]b, corresponding to TEM analysis.
 A typical region of the clusters is magnified in [fig13]c, showing a number of white dots.
 Since these dots were not found in the clusters in [fig12], the dots must be organic molecules produced by the reactions of the grafted MDI with matrix molecules during modification.
 Epoxy/<i>m</i>-GP nanocomposite in [fig13]d shows a higher quantity of fracture phenomena—voids and layer breakage—than the epoxy/GP in [fig12]c.
 A region randomly selected in [fig13]d is magnified in [fig13]e where many tiny cracks are found; [fig13]f shows a clear image of the cracks which grow in the direction of crack propagation.
 [tbl2] shows the comparison of the ratios for these samples.
', 'A proposed toughening mechanism for epoxy/GP nanocomposites is crack deflection [bib15]—a process where an initial crack tilts and twists when it encounters a rigid inclusion.
', 'Based upon observation and analysis in [fig12 fig13], the toughening mechanisms of these two types of epoxy/GP nanocomposites are proposed as below: (1) When subjected to loading, a high level of stress concentration occurs at the sharp crack tip, which induces local dilation since J230-cured epoxy is relatively ductile (see Fig.
\xa012 in Ref.
 [bib32]). Stress concentrates around each platelet due to the difference in modulus and Poisson ratio between matrix and GP.
 (2) With continued loading, fracture initiates from (i) the interface between GP and matrix, which is difficult to observe using SEM; and (ii) GP where voids, layer breakage and micro-cracks are created as shown in [fig12 fig13]. (3) Upon further loading, the voids, layer breakage and micro-cracks develop, causing catastrophic fracture.
 Since <i>m</i>-GP produced a stronger interface with matrix than GP, <i>m</i>-GP were able to carry a higher level of loading upon fracture, as indicated by the increased quantity of fracture features in [fig13].', 'The toughening mechanisms of epoxy/GP nanocomposites are different to those of spherical nanoparticles-toughened epoxy.
 20–30\xa0nm silica particles induced, constrained and thwarted the nanovoids and matrix dilatation; neither interface debonding nor particle deformation was observed [bib36]. Depending on the matrix stiffness, either matrix shear banding or matrix plastic void growth played a major role in the toughening mechanisms of epoxy toughened by 55-nm rubber particles [bib37]. Regarding epoxy/GP nanocomposites, matrix deformation played a less important role in toughening mechanism, as nearly all fracture phenomena, such as voids, layer breakage and micro-cracks occurred in GP.
