A graphite nanoplatelet/epoxy composite with high dielectric constant and high thermal conductivityA simple strategy for the preparation of composites with high dielectric constant and thermal conductivity was developed through a typical interface design. Graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) with a thickness of 20–50nm are fabricated and homogeneously dispersed in the epoxy matrix. A high dielectric constant of more than 230 and a high thermal conductivity of 0.54W/mK (a 157% increase over that of pure epoxy) could be obtained for the composites with a lower filler content of 1.892vol.%. The dielectric constant still remains at more than 100 even in the frequency range of 105–106
                     Hz. When loaded at 2.703vol.%, GNP/epoxy composites have a dielectric constant higher than 140 in the frequency range of 102–104
                     Hz and a high thermal conductivity of 0.72W/mK, which is a 240% increase over that of pure epoxy. The high dielectric constant and low loss tangent are observed in the composite with the GNPs content of 0.949vol.% around 104
                     Hz. It is believed that high aspect ratio of GNPs and oxygen functional groups on their basal planes are critical issues of the constitution of a special interface region between the GNPs and epoxy matrix and the high performance of the composites.['For smaller, faster, more flexible and higher performance embedded passives such as resistors, capacitors and inductors in integrated circuit, high dielectric constant (high-κ) polymer materials with high thermal conductivity is required [b0005]. Desirable and high-performance energy storage devices are needed to enable efficient, versatile, and environmentally friendly uses of energy including electricity.
 Hence, problems associated with electric charge storage, transportation and heat dissipation in these materials have been aggravated [b0010 b0015 b0020 b0025 b0030]. Normally, ferroelectric ceramic and metallic particles are incorporated into polymer matrix to achieve high-κ composites, which also present a number of limitations such as high weight, low flexibility, and poor mechanical performance [b0010 b0305 b0040 b0045 b0050]. However, due to the low thermal conductivities of ferroelectric ceramics, large enhancement in thermal conductivity of the resulted polymer-based composites might not be easily realized.
 Meanwhile, the high volume fraction of traditional micro-scale spherical and rod-like thermal conductive fillers such as aluminum nitride (AlN), silicon nitride (Si3N4) and copper particles, which was necessary to achieve the high thermal conductivity of the composites, cannot afford excellent dielectric properties for the composites [b0055 b0060]. Therefore, the composites with combination of high dielectric constant and high thermal conductivity, though not easy to be achieved, possess great potential in the application of energy storage devices.
', 'The existence of interface regions at polymer-filler interfaces has been revealed, and a concept of the multi-core model suggesting the importance of interface regions was proposed.
 The appropriate design of interface region becomes a critical issue for achieving high-performance materials [b0065 b0070 b0075 b0080 b0085 b0090 b0095]. Recently, several efforts have been performed with focus on interfacial controlling of polymer based composites.
 Core–shell structured barium titanate (BaTiO3)/poly(methyl methacrylate) nanocomposites were successfully prepared through in situ atom transfer radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate from the surface of BaTiO3 nanoparticles [b0100]. It was observed that all the nanoparticles were embedded in the polymer matrix due to strong interfacial bonding and excellent dispersion of the BaTiO3 nanoparticles.
 The dielectric permittivity of the core–shell structured hybrid nanoparticles can be tailored by interface region design, that is, varying the polymer shell thickness, but with rare influence upon the relaxation process.
 Non-covalent and covalent functionalization of boron nitride (BN) nanoplatelets were performed by octadecylamine (ODA) and hyperbranched aromatic polyamide (HBP), respectively, and the effect of functionalized BN nanoplatelets on the thermal properties of epoxy composites was investigated [b0105]. The chemical reaction of HBP functionalized BN with epoxy matrix formed a strong interface, resulting in the best dispersion of nanoplatelets in matrix and the most increment of thermal properties.
 The physical molecular entanglements between ODA from non-covalent functionalized BN with epoxy matrix produced an intermediate interface interaction, which resulted in relatively good dispersion of nanoplatelets and the moderate improvement of thermal properties.
 The BN nanoplatelets showed weak interface for the BN/epoxy composites because neither chemical bonding nor molecular entanglement occurred between nanoplatelets and matrix.
', 'In addition, owing to high aspect ratio, outstanding physical properties and cost efficiency, graphite nanosheets are considered to be effective filler for dielectric or thermal conductive enhancement in polymer matrix as compared to carbon nanotubes [b0025 b0110 b0115]. The morphology and dielectric properties of layered graphene nanosheet (GNS)/polyvinylidene fluoride composites were intensively investigated, and the composites exhibited much higher dielectric constant and lower percolation threshold than materials filled with carbon nanotubes, which was attributed to the orientation and homogeneous dispersion of GNS [b0120]. Epoxy resin showed poor thermal conductivity but the inclusion of graphite sheets resulted in significant improvements.
 A 5wt.
% graphite oxide-filled epoxy resin showed a thermal conductivity of ∼1W/mK, which is approximately four times higher than that of the neat epoxy resin [b0125]. Despite of many researches on the graphite nanosheet/polymer composites, it is still interesting to explore an approach to obtaining a novel composite with high dielectric constant and high thermal conductivity through interface design.
 In this present work, we reported a simple strategy to fabricate very thin graphite nanoplatelets (GNPs) with unique characteristics.
 The aspect ratio of GNPs and the content of oxygen functional groups on basal planes are easily adjustable, which facilitate the interface designing when incorporated with epoxy matrix.
 A composite with high dielectric constant and high thermal conductivity could be achieved through an appropriate interface region design.
'].
[['Surface chemistry of GNPs', ['[f0005](a) illustrated that after the oxidation and ultrasonication, the graphite flakes completely exfoliated into very thin platelets, forming oxygen-containing GNPs.
 As shown in [f0005](b), the D band of GNPs becomes stronger and broader, suggesting a higher level of disorder of the graphene layers and defects introduced during the functionalization process.
 The ratio of the intensities (<i>I</i>D/<i>I</i>G) for GNP was slightly increased, indicating the formation of some sp3 carbon after acid oxidation.
 The XPS results in [f0005](c) showed that the initial oxygen concentration on graphite was only a small proportion of 5.68%, but after oxidation and ultrasonication, it drastically increased to 27.15% along with the reduction in carbon content.
 High-resolution core-level C 1s spectra for GNPs was present in [f0005](d), and this band indicated that a considerable degree of oxidation with four major signatures corresponding to carbon atoms in different functional groups.
 After ultrasonic treatment, the expanded graphite worms were fragmented into GNPs with the thickness of 20–50nm, as shown by [f0005](e).']], ['Morphology of GNP/epoxy composites', ['For the purpose of interface region designing, the controllable formation of oxygenic functional groups on the basal planes of GNPs was considered to be a critical issue.
 During the curing process of epoxy matrix, strong interfacial adhesion and chemical reaction were speculated to occur between functionalized GNPs and epoxy molecular chains, as illustrated in [f0010].', 'As revealed in [f0015], isolated GNPs were homogeneously dispersed in epoxy matrix and almost no large agglomerates or bundles were observed.
']], ['Dielectric properties of GNP/epoxy composites', ['The variations of the dielectric properties with increased frequency ranging from 102 to 106Hz for pure epoxy and GNP/epoxy composites are shown in [f0020]. At a lower frequency range (102–104Hz), the dielectric constant of GNP/epoxy composite improved dramatically, and up to higher than 230 when the filler content was 1.892vol.%. Moreover, this value still remained at more than 100 even in the frequency of 106Hz.
 It was notable that at the filler content of 0.949vol.%, the dielectric constant of the composite was almost frequency independent and reached above 60 over the frequency range of 102–105Hz.
 The loss tangent of the composite, however, kept values lower than 0.3 around 104Hz, which indicated a promising composite with high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss.
 Thus, considerably high loss tangent of the composites with higher volume fraction of GNPs could be observed in [f0020](b). Normally, the conductivity of GNP/epoxy composites originated two mechanism: (1) Ohmic conduction (frequency independent), through direct contact of GNPs, and (2) non-Ohmic conduction (frequency dependent), through the barrier-tunneling effect between GNPs separated by an epoxy layer.
 As revealed in [f0020](c), the percolation transition can be considered as the transition from non-Ohmic conduction to Ohmic conduction.
 When the filler content exceed a critical value (higher than 1.351vol.%), the variation of ac conductivities of the composites are frequency independent when the external field frequency is lower than 1kHz.
 According to the literature [b0130 b0135 b0140 b0145], the ac conductivities of the composites at 100 and 1kHz were the mostly used data to calculate the percolation threshold.
, at 100Hz), we had to choose the latter frequency of 1kHz.
 The best fit of the experimental ac conductivity values to the plot of power laws give <i>f</i>c=1.51vol.% and <i>s</i>=1.36, and the critical exponent value is close to the value of PVDF/exfoliated graphite nanosheets [b0150]. Besides, it is notable that a high dielectric constant of more than 230 and a high thermal conductivity of 0.54W/mK could be achieved simultaneously for the composite with the GNPs content of 1.892vol.%.', 'The significant increase of dielectric constant can be mainly attributed to the interfacial polarization in heterogeneous epoxy system filled with GNPs and to the mini-capacitor principle.
 The former phenomenon is known as the Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars (MWS) mechanism which is caused by the large difference in dielectric constant between the polymer matrix and the fillers [b0130 b0135]. A large increase in permittivity is observed at the percolation limit as in the case of electrical conductivity.
 The mini-capacitor principle can be invoked as being responsible for such increment [b0155]. With increase of GNPs content in polymer phase, the isolation distances between neighboring GNPs are continuously reduced.
 As can be seen in the calculation of critical exponent, the value of s is higher than universal ones (<i>s</i>=0.8–1) were explained by unusual models, such as the inverse Swiss-cheese model. The inverse Swiss-cheese model, which is based on a medium made of conducting particles embedded in an insulating matrix, where the conduction process is controlled by inter-particle tunneling.
 Besides, inhomogeneous composites were found to show better dielectric properties than the homogeneous composites [b0160 b0165]. Therefore, the inhomogeneous nature may be another reason for the large deviation of dielectric constant from the Maxwell relation.
', 'The multi-core model of the interface has been prominent in a number of contributions concerning the dielectric behavior of composites [b0065 b0170 b0175], and the effective dielectric constant of the composite may be influenced through the variation of any of the interface characteristics [b0065 b0110 b0115]. Since the chemical structure of the interface region is a function of the polymer and its interaction with the surface of the filler particles, changes of the bonding situation between these two phases will alter the effective dielectric constant of the composite [b0100 b0180 b0185 b0190 b0195]. Therefore, the controlling of aspect ratio and surface chemistry of GNPs could be an effective way to realizing the interface designing, thereby achieving the composites with both high dielectric constant and high thermal conductivity.
 [f0025] illustrates the multi-core model of the interface region of GNP/epoxy composites.
']], ['Thermal properties of GNP/epoxy composites', ['As expected, the thermal conductivities of the polymeric composites were strongly dependent on the GNPs content, with higher volume fractions consistently resulting in higher thermal conductivities of the composites, shown in [f0030]. When the filler content was 2.703vol.%, the thermal conductivity of the epoxy resin achieved 0.72W/mK a 2.4-fold improvement, which showed large advantages comparing to that of composites filled with AlN, Si3N4 and copper particles [b0055 b0060 b0200]. Meanwhile, with the incorporation of 2.703vol.% GNPs, the dielectric constant of the composites was higher than 140 at 102–104Hz, accompanied by considerably dielectric loss.
', 'Recently, it was found that fillers with high aspect ratio, such as whiskers and platelets, can form more continuous thermally conductive pathways in the polymer matrix and thus are more effective in enhancing the thermal transfer [b0205]. Combined with the high intrinsic thermal conductivity of GNPs, these offered reasonable explanations for the larger increment of thermal conductivity of GNP/epoxy composites with increasing filler content than traditional thermally conductive fillers.
 It has been acknowledged that the thermal conductivity of polymeric composite is mechanistically limited by the polymer-filler interfacial thermal resistance, resulting from the presence of a weak interfacial interaction between soft epoxy layer and rigid GNP hinders the phonon transport [b0210 b0215 b0220]. With the oxygenic groups on the basal planes of GNPs, a homogeneous GNP network in the epoxy matrix could be achieved under relatively higher filler content, as also can be seen in the SEM fractographs of the composite.
 Thus the thinner polymer layers on the surface would decrease the scattering for the phonon transfer and promote the diffusion of phonons in the overall composites, which has been proved in the polymeric systems filled with carbon nanotubes or GNP/carbon nanotubes [b0225 b0230 b0235 b0240]. Surface modification of the particles had already been proved to be a wide applicable technique to prevent from the filler aggregation and enhance particle-matrix interfacial interaction, and enhanced interfacial adhesion by chemical bonding is an effective way to decrease interfacial thermal resistance [b0245 b0250 b0255]. The short and rigid interfacial bonding (covalent bonds) can cause significant reduction of the acoustic impendance mismatch and minimization of interfacial phonon scattering in the overall composites [b0285 b0290]. In GNPs, the inside graphene layers functioned as highly conductive channels for thermal transport, while the chemically functionalized outside layers could afford sufficient covalent and non-covalent bonding with the matrix molecule chains, and facilitated the phonon transfer from the graphene oxide to the polymer matrix [b0025]. With the oxygenic groups on the surface of GNPs, the covalent bridge bonds between GNPs and epoxy molecular chains minimized the interfacial phonon scattering and decreased the interface heat resistance by interpenetrating particles-resin interface.
 In addition, a collaborative effect among fillers through the second and third layer would work for better thermal conductivity, either, which had been illustrated in silica-polyimide composites [b0295].', 'Agari’s semi-empirical model is based on the generalization of series and parallel conduction models in the composite and correlates thermal conductivity with the ability of fillers to create particle conductive chains.
 The logarithmic equation of Agari is [b0275]:  logk   c  = φC   2  logk   f  + ( 1 - φ ) log (C   1 k   p  ) where <i>k</i>c, <i>k</i>p and <i>k</i>f are respectively the thermal conductivity of the composite, of the polymer matrix and of the fillers.
 <i>φ</i> is the filler volume fraction, and <i>C</i>1 and <i>C</i>2 are obtained by fitting experimental data.
 A logarithmic plot of thermal conductivity values as a function of the filler volume concentration is presented in the inset graph of [f0030], and the two parameters <i>C</i>1 and <i>C</i>2 were calculated to be 0.73 and −0.186. The value of 0.73 for <i>C</i>1 suggested that the GNPs with abundant functional groups could affect the curing process of epoxy resin chains and decrease the cross-linking degree of the matrix.
 The low value of <i>C</i>2 suggested that the GNPs have strong ability to create continuous thermal conductive chains, and the formation of conductive network becomes much easier with the incorporation of GNPs.
 As mentioned in recent results, when the size of fillers decreases from micro-scale to nano-scale, the <i>C</i>2 value might have a negative value representing the overwhelming ability of GNPs to create continuous chains [b0060]. Besides, Agari and his co-workers assumed that there is a relationship between <i>C</i>2 parameter obtained from the fitting of thermal conductivity data and the concentration at electrical percolation threshold when the polymeric matrix is filled with metallic particles.
 In this case, the Agari’s model becomes:  log (k   c  /k   p  ) = φC   2  log (k   f  /k   p  )', 'Finally, Agari et al. showed that <i>C</i>2 remains a curve fitting parameter that can be used to determine the electrical percolation threshold using: C   2  = log ( 1 /φ   c  ) where <i>φ</i>c is determined as the volume concentration at the inflection point in the electrical resistivity versus filler concentration curve, i.
 When <i>C</i>1 is defined as unity and <i>C</i>2 values from linear fitting of thermal conductivity of the composites (<i>C</i>2=−0.186), the value of <i>φ</i>c is calculated to 1.53vol.%. According to the analysis of dielectric properties, the percolation threshold of the GNP/epoxy composites was found to be 1.51vol.%. Besides, one important assumption is that the crystallinity of the polymer does not change in the presence of filler particles.
 The GNPs took part in the curing process of epoxy resin and caused a lower <i>C</i>1 value, which resulted in a higher <i>C</i>2 value and lower <i>φ</i>c value.
