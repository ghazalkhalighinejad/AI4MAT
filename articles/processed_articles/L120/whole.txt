Dielectric enhancement in polymer-nanoparticle composites through interphase polarizabilityDielectric measurements on polyimide-oxide nanoparticle composite thin films show a composite dielectric constant (εcomposite) that increased monotonically with increasing oxide content well above the value predicted by Maxwell’s rule for dielectric mixtures below the percolation threshold. Above certain volume fractions, the measured εcomposite values were found to exceed the corresponding nanoparticle ε such that εpolymer < εparticle < εcomposite contrasted to conventional composites where εpolymer < εcomposite < εparticle. The εcomposite was independent of frequency to 10MHz with dielectric loss of <0.005 throughout this range, indicating that the observed enhancement in ε does not originate from space-charge related contributions and hence should be due to dipolar contributions. The observed ε enhancement (εcomposite−εMaxwell) showed a correlation with the total surface area of the nanoparticles. The dielectric model of Vo and Shi [Microelectron. J. 33, 409 (2002), and references therein] showed that the enhanced dielectric behavior originates from significant interfacial nanoparticle-polymer interactions and the critical role of additional contributions to polarizability through specific physicochemical interactions within the interphase region. An interphase εint considerably higher than that of the nanoparticle and a high interface interaction constant of 3.24 for the nanocomposite suggest a strong interaction between the functional groups of the polymer and the nanoparticle surface. Although modeling suggests a maximum of ε∼65vol%, loss in micromechanical stability occurred above 20% due to incomplete polymer wetting films arising from the high nanoparticle surface areas. ['Polymer-based nanocomposites are gaining considerable research attention for applications in resistive, inductive, and capacitive components sector that provide light weight, flexible, and volume efficient electrical components required for embedded passive technologies.
 It has been pointed out that the discrete passive components in cellular phone applications dominate active components by 20-fold and occupy about 80% of the circuit board area.
1 Also, high dielectric constant polymer nanocomposites are being evaluated to provide filtering, bypassing, and power-ground decoupling for noise suppression in high-speed electronics.
 Additionally polymer-oxide nanocomposites are favored in forming components on flexible organic substrates since they require lower processing temperatures while providing the high dielectric constant of oxides as well as overcoming the fragility of pure oxide films.
2,3 Mechanisms of the dielectric polarization which govern dielectric properties in the low-frequency region are dipolar and space-charge polarizations.
 While space-charge polarization becomes negligible at about 10kHz , the dipolar contribution continues to operate up to frequencies up to 10MHz .4 Many of the dielectric composites reported exploit space-charge contributions arising from the electrical double layers formed across interfaces between the host polymer and the filler particles.
5,6 A polymer composite employing conductive particles has been shown by Vo and Wong1 and Rao et al.2 to achieve high dielectric constants by increasing the conductive particle volume fraction close to but not exceeding the percolation threshold within the polymer medium.
 Such a heterostructure of conductive particles separated by very thin insulating polymer films can be considered as a cascade of capacitors connected in series and parallel operating through space-charge polarization.
 The dielectric constant of the polymer medium has been also frequently increased by incorporation of high dielectric constant particles such as barium titanate, lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT), and titanium dioxide.
7–11 Typical particle volume fractions of about 40% produce effective composite dielectric constants of about 45 for BaTiO3 , a material which itself has a dielectric constant of about 6000.9 Whereas PMN-PT, with a dielectric constant of 17\u2009880 at a volume fraction of 85% produced a composite with an effective dielectric constant of 150 (Refs.
 1 and 2) but due to the high particulate loading had poor micromechanical properties.
 Nelson and Fothergill12 have recently shown that TiO2 nanoparticles, in contrast to larger particles, in an epoxy matrix exhibited significantly reduced interfacial space-charge properties and adopted a dominant dipolar (Maxwell-Wagner) polarization contribution.
 Frequency-dependent dielectric measurements showed that, over all the frequencies examined, the nanoparticles produced composite dielectric constants lower than the corresponding micron-sized particles even though the nanoparticles were considered to be surrounded by high charge concentrations in the Gouy-Chapman-Stern layer.
 Subsequently,13 electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and electroluminescence measurements have shown that the hydroxy (OH) groups at the nanoparticle interface influenced the cross linking reactions and thereby reduced the polymer density at the interface resulting in the reduction of the real part of the composite relative permittivity and enhancing the short term dielectric strength.
 The role of nanoparticle interfaces in determining the dielectric properties of dielectric and piezoelectric composites has also been recently reviewed by Lewis14 for both passive interfaces where the response to the applied electrical field is within the electrical double layer and active interfaces where the response is electromechanical. There have been many attempts to model and predict the dielectric behavior of dielectric mixtures including polymer composites according to various mixing rules such as the Maxwell-Wagner, Lichtenecker, and Bruggeman expressions.
15 To improve this approach, Rao et al.16 developed an effective-medium-theory model for polymer-oxide composites.
 Here the polymer matrix and the particle are represented by an effective medium such that the electromagnetic response is identical to that of the original biphasic material, whose dielectric constant value was derived by fitting the experimental response, which provided improvements to the Lichtenecker logarithmic model. More recently, Vo and Shi17 have utilized an empirical three phase model that recognizes a distinct interphase region surrounding the oxide particles of these polymer composites whose layer thickness depended on the degree of interaction between the polymer and the particle and resulted in a nonmonotonic relationship of the dielectric constant with particle volume fraction contrary to the Maxwell-Wagner prediction.
 This model was extended to evaluate the role of chemical coupling agents in influencing molecular polarization and dielectric behavior of the interphase region within polymer-oxide composites.
18 The fabrication and characterization of polyimide-oxide (PI-oxide) nanocomposite thin films with enhanced dielectric behavior are reported in this paper.
 This enhancement is shown to arise from an additional contribution due to specific physicochemical interaction between the functionalities of the nanoparticle and the polymer chains.
 The results are discussed in the light of the model proposed by Vo and Shi in which the critical role of these additional contributions to polarizability within the interphase is demonstrated.

 PI-alumina nanocomposite thin films  Figure 3 shows the frequency dependence of the composite dielectric constant (𝜀composite) at room temperature for PI-alumina nanocomposite thin films of different alumina loading fractions.
 The variation of 𝜀composite at 100kHz with alumina volume fraction is plotted in Fig.
 4. A dielectric constant of 3.5 was obtained for particle-free PI film, a value comparable to that specified for the BPDA-ODA polyimide by the manufacturer.
 A dielectric constant of 15 was obtained for the nanocomposite thin film with 20-vol% alumina content.
 The 𝜀composite did not show any appreciable decrease in the frequency over the range of 1kHz–10MHz . The dielectric loss was also small throughout this frequency range with a value less than 0.005, indicating that the observed enhancement in the dielectric constant does not originate from space-charge related contribution and hence should be due to dipolar contributions.
 According to Maxwell’s rule for dielectric mixtures, in the absence of a space-charge polarization contribution, the maximum value for the 𝜀composite that can be achieved for a PI-alumina nanocomposite will be 10 (the value for the alumina particles) as indicated by the solid line in Fig.
 4 which follows Maxwell’s rule.
 5). The surface area data, obtained from Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (B.
1,2,21 Recent studies17,21 have modeled these composites by assuming the formation of an “interphase” region at the interfaces of the polymer and the filler particle.
 Vo et al.22 formulated a model for polymer-particle composites to explain both the variation of the thermal-expansion coefficient as well as the variation of dielectric properties of the epoxy-oxide composites exhibiting an increase above that anticipated by Maxwell’s rule.
 This was successfully applied to fit the data obtained by Rao et al.2 on epoxy-(PMN-PT) composite and Xue’s21 data on epoxy-BaTiO3 composite.
17 In this model, the interphase region is considered as a unique phase with a different dielectric constant, which can be greater or smaller than that of the filler or the polymer matrix.
 Here an 𝐴𝐵𝐴𝐵 type of cubic-structured filling pattern was used to arrive at a particle fill factor and a resulting interface volume (𝑉int) under these ideal dispersion conditions, as given by 𝑉int=𝑁4𝜋𝑟2𝛥𝑟=𝑁43𝜋𝑟33𝛥𝑟𝑟=𝑉par3𝛥𝑟𝑟, where 𝑁, 𝑟, 𝛥𝑟, and 𝑉par are the number and radius of the filler particles, the thickness of the interphase and volume of the filler, respectively.
 From the above and taking into account that physical clustering may occur, a value of the interphase volume fraction was given as 𝜙int=𝐾0𝜙par𝜙pol, (2) where 𝜙int, 𝜙par, and 𝜙pol are the volume fractions of interphase, particles, and polymer, respectively.
 𝐾0. is a constant that is dependent on the degree of particle clustering influencing the surface area and the thickness of the interphase region between the nanoparticles.
 A value of zero for 𝐾0 indicates that there is no interphase region between the filler particle and polymer matrix and the composite obeys Maxwell’s rule for dielectric mixtures.
 Using the expression for 𝑉int in terms of the known parameters, the volume of the composite 𝑉𝐶 can be written as 𝑉𝐶=𝑉par+𝑉pol+𝐾0𝑉par𝑉pol𝑉𝐶. (3) For a three component system, Vo and Shi expressed the dielectric constant of the composite by 𝜀𝐶=ℎ+2𝑙ℎ−𝑙, (4) where ℎ is given by ℎ=1+2(𝜀3−𝜀2)(𝜀2−𝜀1)(2𝜀3+𝜀2)(2𝜀2+𝜀1)𝑎3𝑏3−2(𝜀3−1)(𝜀3−𝜀2)(𝜀3+2)(2𝜀3+𝜀2)𝑏3𝑐3−2(𝜀3−1)(𝜀3+2𝜀2)(𝜀2−𝜀1)(𝜀3+2)(2𝜀3+𝜀2)(2𝜀2+𝜀1)𝑎3𝑐3, (5) and 𝑙 is 𝑙=[(𝜀3−1)𝜀3+2𝑗−(2𝜀3+1)𝑚(𝜀3+2)(2𝜀3+𝜀2)𝑏3𝑐3], (6) where 𝜀𝑐, 𝜀1, 𝜀2, and 𝜀3 are the dielectric constants of the composite, particles, interphase, and polymer matrix, respectively, and 𝑎 is the radius of the filler, 𝑏−𝑎 is the thickness of the interphase region and 𝑐 is the radius of the equivalent composite.
 (4) (Fig.
 6) where the values of 𝐾0 of 3.24 and 𝜀int of 280 provided the best fit.
 The model predictions which Vo and Shi17 made for the experimental data from Rao et al.,2 using PMN-PT particles of dielectric constant (𝜀par) of 17880, are also plotted for reference.
 Figure 6 also shows that these enhancements are gained at low particle volume fractions, well below the percolation threshold, compared to the conventional dielectric composites reported so far.
 A further difference between the two composites considered above is the average size of the particulate material. While the average particle size of the PMN-PT used by Rao et al. was 900nm , the average particle size of alumina used in the current experiment was 10nm , two orders of magnitude smaller and giving an interphase material volume fraction in the PI-alumina nanocomposite about three orders of magnitude larger than that formed in the epoxy-(PMN-PT) composite of Rao et al. The interphase volume was calculated for different PI-alumina nanocomposites using Eqs.
 (2) and (3) from the model and the value of 𝐾0 obtained from Fig.
 6. Combining these values with the surface area in Fig.
 5 yields a thickness of the interphase layer of about 4nm . Figure 7 shows the variation of the effective dielectric constant across the full compositional range for the PI-alumina nanocomposite thin films calculated using the 𝐾0 and 𝜀int values obtained in Fig.
 6. According to the model, a maximum 𝜀composite value is obtained for this composite at 65vol%. However, the experimental fabrication of nanocomposite thin films with alumina contents of >25vol% showed a limit to their mechanical stability, which may be due to the insufficient polymer to create complete wetting films over the large nanoparticle surface area.
 Silica has a dielectric constant of 3.9, which is close to that of the polyimide matrix unlike the alumina case where the dielectric constant value is higher than the polymer medium.
 The 𝜀composite of PI-silica nanocomposite films, like the PI-alumina nanocomposite films, also showed constant values in the frequency range of 1kHz–10MHz together with a small dielectric loss factor throughout this frequency range (less than 0.005). The variation of 𝜀composite (at 100kHz) with silica volume fraction is plotted in Fig.
 8. The 𝜀composite of PI-silica nanocomposite thin films increased with increasing silica content, with a dielectric constant value of 9.5 obtained for 15-vol% silica.
 Application of the model of Vo and Shi to the experimental data of PI-silica system yielded a 𝐾0 value of 5.01 and an 𝜀int value of 19.24 for the best fit.
 Figure 9 shows a comparison of the model prediction for PI-silica system (𝐾0=5.01 and 𝜀int=19.24) with the PI-alumina system (𝐾0=3.24 and 𝜀int=280). It can be seen that the systems behave differently with different values of interface interaction factor (𝐾0) but both result in enhanced dielectric characteristics.
 Figure 10 shows the temperature coefficient of capacitance for the PI-alumina nanocomposite thin films to be very small (<0.1pF∕°C) in the temperature range of 25–150°C through out the frequency range for both the PI-alumina and PI-silica thin films.
 11). Young’s modulus increased from 0.871GPa for the particle-free PI to 2.04 GPa for the PI-alumina nanocomposite film with 10-vol% alumina.
 Compositions with particle contents of >20% were rigid preventing their micromechanical characterization.
