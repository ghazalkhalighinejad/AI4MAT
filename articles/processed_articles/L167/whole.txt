Preparation and dielectric behaviors of thermoplastic and thermosetting polymer nanocomposite films containing BaTiO3 nanoparticles with different diametersBaTiO3 (BT) nanoparticles with three kinds of diameters were synthesized by alkoxide route and then dispersed into a thermoplastic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and a thermoset polyimide (PI)) to fabricate the BT/PVDF and the BT/PI nanocomposite films. Effects of nanoparticle size and polymer matrix on the dielectric properties were studied by two different measurement procedures at frequencies from 10−2
                     Hz to 106
                     Hz. A significant discrepancy of dielectric behaviors between the BT/PVDF films and the BT/PI films was found. The roles of nanoparticles (size and crystal phase) and properties of polymers (chemistry and chain structure) are used to explain the difference in dielectric behaviors.['Dielectric composites comprising of polymer matrix and inorganic particles have been widely studied due to the unique combination of their distinct dielectric properties and desirable processing ease.
 Such materials with high dielectric permittivity have opened opportunities for a myriad of applications, such as embedded capacitors, gate dielectrics, and electric energy storage devices [b0005 b0010 b0015 b0020]. Comparing with microsized particles, the nanoparticle-loaded composites possess a large interfacial area, dramatically promoting the exchange coupling effect through a interface layer and resulting in strong polarization and different dielectric responses [b0005 b0025]. Therefore, the research on dielectric properties of nanocomposites has been paid more attention in this field [b0030 b0035 b0040 b0045 b0050 b0055 b0060 b0065 b0070].', 'Previous state-of-the-art researches have confirmed that the size and crystal phases of inorganic nanoparticles played a crucial role in determining the dielectric behaviors of their nanocomposites [b0075 b0080]. The dielectric permittivities of BaTiO3 (BT) nanoparticles decrease with reducing diameter of particles as a result from the transformation in crystal phases of BT.
 Specifically, ferroelectric tetragonal BT (large diameter) has coupled with a permittivity as high as 1200 at room temperature, while cubic BT (small diameter) shows no ferroelectricity and a low permittivity [b0085]. The different physical properties of the BT nanoparticles supported that they have a remarkable effect on the final dielectric performances of the BT/polymer nanocomposites [b0090]. Moreover, such effect of nanoparticles on dielectric behavior would vary with polymer matrixes in the composites [b0095 b0100]. We have also reported the dielectric behaviors of PVDF-matrix nanocomposites loaded with different-size BT nanoparticles [b0075 b0090]. A significant increasing of dielectric permittivity at low frequency was observed.
 However, when the different-size BT nanoparticles were loaded into PI matrix, the dielectric permittivity of the BT/PI nanocomposite films failed to show such phenomena.
 The difference of polymer matrixes would be attributed to the remarkable discrepancy in the dielectric relaxations.
 Namely, the polarity of PVDF is much stronger than that of PI.
 Besides, PVDF is thermoplastic while PI is thermoset [b0070]. Such different chemical structures and chain interactions would have an effect on the polarization of dipoles and thus the behavior of charges in the materials under applied electric field.
 In light of multiple-region mode [b0100], the polarity and chain interactions of polymer matrix would influence the interface between particles and polymer matrix, consequently affecting the charge trapping and electron scattering at interface in the composites.
 Hence, the features of polymer matrixes also play an essential role in determining the dielectric properties of the nanocomposite films.
 Effect of the chemical structures of polymers, the size and morphology of fillers on dielectric performances is definitely necessary but has not yet been addressed to date.
 Therefore, in this study, we compared two kinds of BT/polymer nanocomposite films in order to discuss the collaborative effect of polymer matrices and nanoparticles on dielectric behaviors in wide range of frequency (10−2–106 Hz).'].
[['Morphology and purity of the BT nanoparticles', ['SEM images in [f0005]a–c give the sizes and shapes of BT nanoparticles calcined at three temperatures, respectively.
 It can be observed that the diameter of the BT nanoparticles calcined at 600°C, 900°C and 1100°C is around 30–50nm, 50–80nm and 100–150nm, respectively.
 The similar result could be confirmed in other paper [b0085].', 'XRD patterns presented in [f0005]d show that most of peaks of as-synthesized BT particles can well match the standard pattern of BT (PDF#75-0462) (its crystalline indices (Miller indices) of spectra was showed in [t0005]. Meanwhile, it can also be found that the diffraction peaks of BT particles become sharper with increasing the calcination temperature, suggests that the high calcination temperature would favor to the crystallization and enable the growth of more sufficient and more integration BT crystals, which can also be verified by the SEM images discussed above.
 Additionally, noticeable difference in crystal structure of BT powders can be observed from the inset of [f0005]d.
 Both BT nanoparticles calcined at 900°C and 1100°C have double peaks located at 2<i>θ</i>≈45° while by contrast, only one signal peak is observed for the one calcined at 600°C.
 Furthermore, it can also be found that the distance between two peaks (compared with BT calcined at 900°C and at 1100°C) becomes larger as the temperature increases.
 At 2<i>θ</i>≈45°, double peaks correspond to tetragonal crystal phase while single peak means cubic.
 These two crystal phases are clearly showed in schematic [f0010]. Besides, the distance between two peaks shows the integrality of tetragonal crystal phase.
 The larger the distance between two peaks, the more integrality of tetragonal crystal phase exists in BT particles [b0075]. Hence, high temperature not only favors the formation of the tetragonal crystal phase with high permittivity but also makes the crystal phase get much more integrality.
 Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) of BT (50–80nm) nanoparticles gives further evidences of the little impurity in BT nanoparticles synthesized by alkoxide route, which can be found in [f0015]a and [t0010]. From the elements mapping, it can be observed that Ba, Ti and O elements disperse homogeneously in the BT nanoparticle.
']], ['Morphologies of the BT/polymer nanocomposite films', ['SEM images in [f0020] show surface morphologies of PVDF-based and PI-based composites containing three kinds of BT nanoparticles.
 As showed in [f0020]a–c, the dispersion of BT nanoparticles in two polymer matrices is different at the same volume fraction (50vol.%). Compared with the PI nanocomposite films as showed in [f0020]d–f, the PVDF one is less homogeneous.
 Hence, the differences from matrixes properties and fabrication of nanocomposite films would influence the dispersion of nanoparticles in films [b0100 b0115].']], ['Frequency dependence of dielectric properties of the BT/polymer nanocomposites', ['[f0025] shows the frequency dependences of permittivity (<i>ε</i>eff) and loss tangent (tan<i>δ</i>) of the BT/PVDF nanocomposite films.
 In order to easy discussion, the range of frequency is divided into 2 parts, from 10−2Hz to 103Hz, and from 103Hz to106 Hz.
 At first, within a frequency range from 103Hz to 106Hz, [f0025]a shows the dielectric permittivity of the BT (30–50nm)/PVDF is the lowest, that of the BT (100–150nm)/PVDF is medium, and that of the BT (50–80nm)/PVDF is the highest.
 It would reduce the dielectric permittivity of BT (30–50nm)/PVDF comparing with the other two kinds of BT/PVDF.
 Meanwhile, small size BT nanoparticles would bring more interfaces between matrix and fillers that would lead to a strong interfacial polarization, thus, the dielectric permittivity of BT (50–80nm)/PVDF is higher than that of BT (100–150nm)/PVDF.
 Intriguingly, a significant increase in dielectric permittivity of the nanocomposite films appears in the frequency range from 10−2Hz to 103Hz, especially for the BT (30–50nm)/PVDF, as showed in [f0025]a.
 Since the size of BT (30–50nm) nanoparticle is the smallest among the three kinds of BT nanoparticles, its surface areas are extremely remarkalbe.
 This strongly favors the interfacial polarization in the BT (30–50nm)/PVDF nanocomposites.
 As mentioned above, the higher temperature helped to form better tetragonal crystal phase; naturally, BT with better tetragonal crystal phase would have a high dielectric permittivity [b0075 b0090]. It would result in the permittivity difference between the BT (100–150nm)/PVDF and the BT (50–80nm)/PVDF systems.
 Additionally, it can be found that the positions of the peaks in frequency dependence of loss tangent ([f0025]b) for three kinds of the BT/PVDF nanocomposites are accordant with the change of the relative dielectric permittivities in [f0025]a.
 Therefore, the figures in [f0025]b can be the further evidences of the interfacial polarization at low frequency.
 As shown in [f0030]a, it can be found within the frequency ranges from 10−2Hz to 106Hz, the dielectric permittivity of the BT (30–50nm)/PI is the lowest, that of BT (50–80nm)/PI is medium, and that of BT (100–150nm)/PI is the highest.
 It can be identified that the dielectric permittivity of the BT (30–50nm)/PI increases by 2 times and becomes the highest among the three films while other two have a little enhancement.
 As shown in [f0030]b, it can be seen that the loss tangent of the BT/PI nanocomposite films becomes very high at low frequency.
 Meanwhile, the dielectric loss in [f0030]b is also different from that of the BT/PVDF film in [f0025]b.
 In light of multi-regions mode [b0100], the interfacial regions between nanoparticles and matrix can be divided into three regions as bonded region, transitional region and normal region.
', 'The information shown in [f0030]b, unlike that of the BT/PVDF nanocomposite films in [f0025]b, supports the variety of relaxation polarization and interfacial one caused by the divergence of polymer matrix.
']], ['Frequency dependence of dielectric properties of BT/polymer nanocomposite films at different temperatures', ['In order to research the influence of temperature on dielectric behavior of the BT/polymer nanocomposite films, the dielectric permittivity was measured at three temperatures (−40°C, 20°C and 80°C) as shown in [f0035]. It can be seen that the permittivity of two kinds of BT/polymer nanocomposite films increases with temperature.
 The dielectric permittivity at 25°C of the BT/PVDF films ([f0025]a) is much larger than that of the BT/PVDF measured at 20°C ([f0035]a), especially at low frequency.
 The glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>g) of PVDF matrix is about −39°C.
 Consequently, dielectric permittivity of three kinds of the BT/PVDF nanocomposite films especially for the BT (30–50nm)/PVDF film shows great differences between two measurement processes.
 However, comparing [f0030]a with [f0035]b, there is not much distinction between two results of the BT/PI nanocomposite films in two measurements.
 Since PI matrix has excellent thermal properties whose <i>T</i>g is about 352°C [b0110]. It would be benumbed to the temperature change.
