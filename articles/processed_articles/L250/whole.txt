Bimodal brush functionalized TiO2/silicone nanocomposites with improved dielectric propertiesBimodal ligand engineering was applied in TiO2 /silicone nanocomposites to independently control the nanoparticle dispersion and interface properties. The introduction of well-dispersed anthracene grafted TiO2 nanoparticles improved the AC breakdown strength and retarded the space charge accumulation in silicone rubber. A candidate mechanism of charge trapping and impact ionization of TiO2 and anthracene is proposed to explain the improvements. [' Carefully tuning the interface properties of nanocomposites is critical to achieving good dielectric properties.
 This is usually done by grafting functional molecules to the nanoparticle.
 However, it is difficult to independently control the nanoparticle dispersion and the electronic features of the interface.
 Bimodal ligand engineering has proved an effective way to both introduce functionality and control dispersion [1]. In this method, two types of molecules are grafted to the nanoparticle.
 a low graft density of high molecular weight matrix compatible polymer and a high graft density of electronically active small molecules.
 The grafted polymers are used to create favorable interactions with the matrix and ensure a good dispersion of the nanoparticle, while the small molecules can act as potential charge trapping centers.
 This has been successful in SiO2/epoxy nanocomposites with a low graft density of polyglycidyl methacrylate long chains and a high graft density of small conjugated molecules [1], [2].  In this work, we expand the bimodal ligand engineering method to TiO2/silicone nanocomposites.
 By using a “grafting to” approach, two populations of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chains were grafted to the TiO2 nanoparticles.
 The long chains entangled with the matrix and short chains provided sufficient shielding against the nanoparticle core-core attraction [3]. The nanoparticle dispersion improved after PDMS grafting and further attachment of anthracene molecules did not significantly impact the dispersion.
 The effects of TiO2 and anthracene were investigated by AC breakdown tests, dielectric spectroscopy, pulse electro-acoustic analysis (PEA) and a dc conductivity test.
 '].
 1, the as-synthesized TiO2 tended to agglomerate into clusters larger than 50 nm in the silicone matrix.
 2 shows a Weibull plot of the AC breakdown strength for different samples.
 The introduction of TiO2 nanoparticles regardless of the dispersion does not significantly change the AC breakdown strength of the silicone.
 But the breakdown strength was increased by 8 % in the 2wt% PDMS-Anth-TiO2 filled sample.
 Increasing the loading of nanoparticles to 4wt% did not further improve the breakdown strength.
  The real permittivity of neat silicone and TiO2 filled samples at high frequencies are almost the same with a value of 3.1, see Fig.
 3. At low frequencies, an increase of real and imaginary permittivity was observed in all samples but with different slope and magnitude.
 As Jonscher [4] suggested, χ∗ can be defined as χ∗=[ε∗−ε∞]/ϵ0=χ′−iχ'”, where ε0=8.854×10−12 F m−1, and ε∞ is taken as the real permittivity at the frequency of 1 MHz.
 Several processes can operate in the low frequency region including hopping conduction (also known as low frequency dispersion-LFD) [5], pure dc conduction, and interfacialpolarization.
  In LFD, X follows a power law behavior with frequency[5], χ′(ω)∝χ′′(ω)∝ω−n0<n<1.(1)  The LFD phenomena can easily be confused with the onset of dc conduction, for which χ′(ω)→constχ′′(ω)∝σdc/ω}ω→0(2) with σdc as the frequency-independent dc conductivity [6]. Similarly the Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) interfacial polarization effect predicts a limiting behavior of the form of (2) but on the higher-frequency side of the peak χ′(ω)∝ω−1andχ′(ω)∝ω−2(3) the relaxation time of which scales inversely with the conductivity of each phase [6]. The low frequency power-law behavior of each sample is analyzed and summarized in Table 1. As Fig.
 3 shows, the magnitude of X follows the descending order of neat Sylgard® 184 > 4wt% as-synthesized TiO2, ≈2wt% PDMS-TiO2 > 2wt% PDMS-Anth-TiO2, suggesting that some processes were suppressed with the addition of TiO2 and anthracene.
 From this perspective, the relaxations in neat Sylgard® 184 can be explained as a combination of LFD, dc conduction and the interfacial polarization between silica particles and polymer matrix.
 The introduction of TiO2 reduced the magnitude of the existing interfacial polarization.
 This may be the caused by the TiO2 limiting the movement of space charge, which would shift the polarization to lower frequencies.
 The reduction in conductivity can potentially be explained by trapping of charge by the surface states in TiO2 and anthracene.
 The well dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles and anthracene molecules may provide a myriad of deep traps for both electrons and holes as they have larger electron affinity (EA) (5.1 eV for TiO2 and 0.6 eV for anthracene) and smaller ionization potential (IP) (8.3 eV for TiO2 and 7.4 eV for anthracene) compared to the matrix polymer (estimated as polyethylene EA = −0.65 eV, IP = 8.15 eV) [7]–[8][9]. These traps would reduce the charge mobility and result in a low loss at low frequencies.
 The additional loss peak in the 4wt% as-synthesized TiO2 sample at 10Hz is ascribed to the interfacial polarization between the polymer and TiO2 clusters.
 However, this peak disappeared in samples for which TiO2 nanoparticles were individually dispersed, implying a reduction of local field distortion.
 The trapping of charge by TiO2 and anthracene was further supported by the PEA test.
 The low Young's modulus of silicone rubber causes a large acoustic attenution, which renders the magnitude of the image charge peak at the cathode 1/3 of that at the anode.
 For neat Sylgard® 184 and 2wt% PDMS-TiO2 samples, heterocharge accumulation at the cathode was observed immediately after the voltage application (shown as a small spreaded peak near the cathode), which is not seen in the anthracene modified TiO2 filled sample.
 These fast moving heterocharges have a mobility greater than 10–11 m2 V−1 S-l and may have a solitonic nature as proposed by Montanari et al. [10]. For those charges travelling at a slow speed (JL ~ 10–14 m2 V−1 S-l), both electron and hole injection were observed in all samples and showed different transport speed and injected quantity, in the order of neat Sylard 184 > 2wt% PDMS-TiO2 > 2wt% PDMS-Anth-TiO2, suggesting a trapping mechanism operates in the TiO2 and anthracene modified TiO2 composites.
 The neat Sylgard® 184 sample has the fastest charge decay rate and almost all charges decayed within the first minute, indicating that the charge resides in shallow traps, In the TiO2 and anthracene modified TiO2 filled samples, the charge decayed at a much slower rate.
 Similar phenomena were observed at higher fields of 20 and 30 kV/mm.
 The TiO2 and anthracene modified TiO2 filled samples showed a decrease in conductivity at fields below 40 kV/mm compared to neat Sylgard® 184. In this low field range, we hypothesize that the current in all samples was dominated by space charge injection and transport.
 However, at higher fields (for instance, above 50 kV/mm for the 2wt% PDMS-TiO2 filled sample and above 30 kV/mm for the 2wt% PDMS-Anth-TiO2), a remarkable increase in the current with field was observed.
 This may be caused by impact ionization of TiO2 and anthracene molecules as they have a much smaller band gap (~,3.0 eV) than the matrix polymer (> 8 eV) and thus are subject to easier impact ionization [11]. They would act like electron/hole donors.
 Thus the J-E characteristics can be decribed by the the Poole-Frenkel effect for which the conductivity is given as: σ=N1/2effN1/2Deμexp(−Δ2kBT)exp{e3/2E1/2(4πε0εr)1/2kBT} where Neff is the effective density of states in the conduction band; ND is the density of donors; Δ is the barrier height and μ is the charge mobility [12]. A plot of lnσ Versus E1/2 yields a straight line giving an intercept of ln(N1/2effN1/2Deμ)−Δ/(2kBT) and a slope of e3/2/[(4πε0εr)1/2kBT] (Fig.
 5). The relative permittivity calculated from the slope is 3.5, about 13 % higher than the measured value by dielectric spectroscopy.
 In this case, the dielectric constant used in the equation should involve a local contribution from the TiO2 nanoparticles, which can yield a larger value than the bulk.
 For example, in the 2wt% PDMS-TiO2 sample, if we assume that: 1) the effective density of states is of the same order of magnitude as the number of atoms per unit volume in silicone, Neff=1029m−3,2) the density of donor states equals the volume fraction of the nanoparticles, ND=0.005Neff and 3) the mobility is μ=10−14m2V−1s−1 (deduced from the space charge transport in PEA), the calculated energy barrier is 1.3 eV.
 Similarly, in the 2wt% PDMS-Anth-TiO2 sample, assuming a reduced mobility of μ=10−15m2V−1s, the donor states density from anthracene of ND=0.0005Neff, and subtracting the contribution from TiO2 nanoparticles, the barrier for anthracene is 1.1 eV.
 The ionization of TiO2 nanoparticles or anthracene creates more free electrons/holes, which however may be beneficial to the polymer as it can dissipate the kinetic energy of the hot electrons and limit the electron energy below 4 eV, which is usually considered the threshold energy to break the bonds of polymer chains.
