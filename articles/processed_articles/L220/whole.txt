Antistatic coating and electromagnetic shielding properties of a hybrid material based on polyaniline/organoclay nanocomposite and EPDM rubberThermal, mechanical, electrical and microwave radiation absorbing properties of conductive composites based on dodecylbenzenesulfonate doped polyaniline/organoclay nanocomposites and propylene–ethylidene–norbornene rubber have been investigated with special interest on the effect of the nanocomposite concentration. Composites were prepared by melt blending using an internal mixer. Morphology studies by scanning electron microscopy of cryofractured surfaces indicated that the conducting nanocomposites produced heterogeneously distributed aggregates in the continuous elastomeric matrix. The composites exhibit high conductivities, up to 10−3
                     Scm−1 for 40wt.% of conducting nanocomposite, and good mechanical properties. They also present high microwave attenuation values, in the frequency range of 8–12GHz. This property depends on the concentration of the conductive nanocomposite and on the film thickness. The composites can be used for antistatic coatings or for electromagnetic shielding.['The electromagnetic radiation is one of the unfortunate by-products of the rapid proliferation of electronic devices, specifically due to the rapid development of 1–5GHz electronic and telecommunication systems, such as: mobile phones, wireless internet, LAN system or “Bluetooth” devices and electronic equipment operating at 5V [bib1 bib2]. These radiations interfere with household appliances and may generate disastrous effects in large-scale computers [bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7]. Therefore, radiation-shielding materials are essential for high operational reliability and long life of electronic equipment since they reduce or suppress the electromagnetic noise [bib1 bib2]. Many types of radar absorbing materials (RAM) are also commercially available and, at present, the most cost effective means of shielding radar radiation, controlling electromagnetic interference (EMI) and dissipating electrostatic charge (ESD) is to use magnetic or dielectric fillers [bib1 bib8 bib9 bib10] or intrinsically conducting polymers (ICP) [bib11 bib12 bib13].', 'Due to its high conductivity and many other properties, such as environmental stability and rather simple synthesis, ICP became the focus of attention for preparation of new materials for the fabrication of industrial devices [bib14 bib15 bib16]. Specifically, ICP provide bands of delocalized π molecular orbitals, and a full range of semiconductor and metal behaviors can be achieved through the control of the degree of band filling, i.
e.
 chemical doping [bib17]. For many applications, this material must be prepared in the form of films on a large scale using the techniques applied to the production of thermoplastic polymer films.
 Thus, it is necessary to prepare blends with conventional thermoplastics, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC) [bib18] or polystyrene (PS) [bib19 bib20]. In addition, the ICP not only reflect but also absorb electromagnetic wave, and may attain high levels of shielding performance [bib17]. For this purpose successful combinations of ICP with different processable insulating polymers have been reported in the literature, such as poly(ethylene-<i>co</i>-propylene-<i>co</i>-ethylidene-norbornene) (EPDM) [bib21] and poly(butadiene-<i>co</i>-acrylonitrile) (NBR) [bib22].', 'One way to improve the bulk properties of an ICP is to confine it in nanoscale environments.
 Thus, there are reports on the preparation and properties of lamellar nanocomposites based on conducting polymers, like polyaniline, with various layered host materials, such as: FeOCl [bib23], V2O5  [bib24], MnPS3  [bib25 bib26], MoO3  [bib27], MoS2  [bib28] and silicates, specifically montmorillonite (MMT) clays [bib29 bib30 bib31 bib32]. The interest in these materials is due to their synergistic effect owing to the intimate mixing between inorganic and organic components at a molecular level. In these materials the conductivity is controlled by two antagonistic effects: (i) confinement of the ICP in the interlayer space disrupts the three-dimensional organization of the polymer chains and lowers the intermolecular interactions and (ii) the extended polymer chain with high conjugation and a small number of polymer bridges enhances the conductivity of the hybrid nanocomposite, facilitating electron transport between different layers [bib30 bib33]. Thus, the combination of a conducting polymer with an inorganic host opens a way to obtain new conducting nanocomposites with novel properties.
 According to Yang and Chen [bib34], if the native clay layers are modified by suitable organic cations, more monomer or prepolymers can be intercalated into the clay layer, prior to polymerization.
 This method of organophilic MMT clay modification is based on a cation-exchange reaction between the clay and a tetra-alkylammonium salt (surfactant molecule), such as dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide.
 Thus, through chemical modification, the hydrophilic clay surface becomes organophilic and, therefore, compatible with certain conventional organic polymers [bib35].', 'Due to the high electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite, it is necessary to dilute the conductive phase to attain the appropriate surface electrical resistance.
 For practical use of microwave absorbers, thermoplastic or rubber composites are more useful than sintered bodies due to their flexibility.
 Thus, the combination of the conducting nanocomposite material with an elastomer leads to new materials with good electrical and mechanical properties and, specially, makes possible the processing of conducting polymers through methods used in the plastics industries and, hence, permits large-scale preparation.

'].
 Also, it was observed that, the induction period for formation of the <i>anilinum</i>-DBSA complex is reduced in the presence of organoclay (1h) as a compared to a conventional polymerization.
 This value is higher than observed by Jia et al. [bib33] because their addition of aniline and DBSA was done at 25°C.
 The conductivity of the PAni-DBSA/organoclay nanocomposite was 4.4±1.0Scm−1, interestingly the same conductivity as the pure PAni-DBSA complex.
 When the content of conducting material is 40wt.
%, the conductivity reaches 10−3 Scm−1 ([fig1] ). This value is high compared to previously reported conductivities for PAni-DBSA/PSS and PAni-DBSA/EPDM blends, at the same concentration of the PAni-DBSA complex [bib20 bib21]. Increasing the amount of the conductive nanocomposite in the insulating matrix seems to create a more perfect conductive network.
 In general, surface resistivities of 104–108 Ωcm are needed for antistatic application [bib2].', 'The XRD patterns of organoclay and PAni-DBSA/organoclay revealed diffraction peaks at 2<i>θ</i> =3.00° and 2.23°, respectively ([fig2] ). The basal spacing in the (001) direction of organoclay, calculated from the Bragg Equation, was increased by a value equivalent to the size of the PAni-DBSA complex, from 29.6 to 39.7Å. Hence, the XRD patterns of PAni-DBSA/organoclay demonstrate that the conducting Pani-DBSA complex is intercalated between the organoclay layers at the nanoscale level. In addition, [fig2] also shows XRD patterns for PAni-DBSA/organoclay//EPDM composites (EPDM-2 and EPDM-4). We can observe an intense XRD signal at 2<i>θ</i> =2° for the composites indicating the presence of the PAni-DBSA/organoclay nanocomposite in the elastomeric matrix.
', '[fig3]  shows the TGA curves for the PAni-DBSA complex, organoclay, PAni-DBSA/organoclay nanocomposites and PAni-DBSA/organoclay-EPDM composites, measured under a synthetic air atmosphere.
 It is observed that the degradation temperature increased from 250°C, for the PAni-DBSA complex, to 285°C, for the PAni-DBSA/organoclay nanocomposites, since the weight loss below 100°C is a result of the residual solvent evaporation (∼5%) ([fig3]A). The PAni-DBSA/organoclay nanocomposites present two degradation stages.
 The first process occurs between 250 and 350°C, corresponding to a weight loss of ∼30%, which is associated to the decomposition of DBSA (bound and in excess). The second degradation process occurs between 350 and 600°C, with 40% weight loss, assigned to decomposition of the organic substances present in the organoclay (alkyl tail), bound DBSA and polymer degradation [bib37]. The onset of decomposition temperature of bound DBSA increases by about 30°C, as observed by Jia et al. [bib33]. Also, it was observed that during the second stage of decomposition the weight loss was lower in comparison to PAni-DBSA complex.
 According to Zanetti et al. [bib38], the barrier effect of the clay increases during volatilization because of the reassembly of the silicate layers on the polymer surface by the thermal decomposition of the alkyl tail present in the organoclay.
 In this study, it was also observed that the PAni-DBSA complex and PAni-DBSA/organoclay nanocomposite present a residual char at 880°C corresponding to a residue of 17 and 33%, respectively.
 Hence, TGA measurement confirmed that the ratio PAni:clay is approximately 1:1.', 'TGA curves of PAni-DBSA/organoclay-EPDM composites indicated that the samples present a lower initial degradation temperature than pure EPDM ([fig3]B). We suggest that is due to loss of excess DBSA.
 These behaviors are assigned to the barrier effect of the clay particles and, thus, hinder the degradation process, as discussed above [bib38]. Hence, the composites present a residual char (above 600°C) proportional to the nanocomposite content in the samples.
', '[fig4]  shows the temperature dependence of storage modulus (<i>E</i>′), loss modulus (<i>E</i>″) and tan delta (<i>δ</i>) of EPDM and PAni-DBSA/organoclay-EPDM composites.
 For all samples studied, the storage modulus decreases as the temperature increases ([fig4]a). However, the storage modulus increases as a function of PAni-DBSA/organoclay nanocomposite content.
 The loss modulus of all PAni-DBSA/organoclay-EPDM composites increased in comparison to pure EPDM ([fig4]b). In these curves, there is one peak at low temperature (∼−40°C), indicating the α-transition of EPDM, described as the glass transition temperature (<i>T</i> g) [bib39].', 'In the tan <i>δ</i> versus temperature plots, [fig4]c, we observe the decrease in the <i>T</i> g of the composites, which may be explained by the increase of free volume as a function of the nanocomposite content.
', "The stress–strain curves for EPDM and PAni-DBSA/organoclay-EPDM composites are shown in [fig5] . The composites present the stress–strain behavior observed for typical uncrosslinked elastomers.
 Also, mechanical parameters, like elongation, stress at break and Young's modulus depend strongly on the concentration of the PAni-DBSA/organoclay nanocomposite ([tbl1] ). The material becomes more rigid according to the nanocomposite content, as expected from the addition of a reinforcing filler to an elastomer.
", '[fig6]  shows the SEM photographs of EPDM-2 and EPDM-4 samples.
 This is due to the low shear stress and processing time, which do not make an exfoliated material. Interestingly, the morphology attained permits suggesting that the material presents excellent microwave absorption properties as verified in previous work [bib21 bib22 bib40]. Hence, reflectivity measurements in the 8–12GHz frequency range were done to measure the shielding effectivity.
', 'The results of reflectivity coefficient <i>R</i> (in decibels, dB) are presented as a function of frequency (GHz) and absorber thickness ([fig7] ). In our study, the permittivity data are not available for the samples, thus, comparison with theoretical reflection curves is not possible.
 −11dB), in the frequency range of 11–12GHz, were obtained when the composites contained 30wt.
% of the PAni-DBSA/organoclay nanocomposite (EPDM-3). This value corresponds to a dissipation of 90% of the incident radiation.
 Also the composite containing 40wt.
% of nanocomposite (EPDM-4) presents radiation attenuation values between −4 and −9dB in the frequency range of 8–12GHz.
 In this case, the composite exhibits a broadband behavior, with microwave radiation absorption of 80% ([fig7]). Hence, the reflectivity properties of EPDM conducting composite depend on composite composition and microstructure attained after processing.
 In this case, the PAni-DBSA/organoclay nanocomposite agglomerates, between the elastomeric phases, act on the wave–matter interaction [bib22] ([fig6]). This shows that these conducting polyaniline nanocomposites are an effective absorber in the microwave range.
 In addition, the PAni-DBSA/organoclay nanocomposite (EPDM-3) present lower microwave absorbing properties, between 8 and 12GHz, that the binary blend based on EPDM and PAni-DBSA complex with the same content of PAni-DBSA complex ([fig7]a). However, the conducting nanocomposite presents the advantage of no loss of DBSA by exudation as a function of time, and presents a shift of the attenuation values to higher frequencies, specifically the maximum of the attenuation values occur at frequencies higher than 12GHz.
', '[fig7]b shows the attenuation curve of the PAni-DBSA/organoclay-EPDM composites as a function of the frequency for samples of different thicknesses.
 We can observe that an increase in the thickness of the sample (two layers) leads to a shift of the attenuation values to lower frequencies, and the EDPM-2 composite attained high radiation attenuation values (ca.
 −10dB), in the frequency range of 8–9GHz, corresponding to an attenuation between 80 and 90% of the incident radiation.
 This is due to the dielectric characteristics of polyaniline known as <i>λ</i>/4 (<i>λ</i> is wavelength of radiation) [bib11 bib20 bib40]. In other words, minimal reflection of the microwave power or matching conditions occurs when the thickness of the absorber approximates a quarter of the propagating wavelength multiplied by an odd number [bib41]. This shows that the attenuation peak frequency of composites can be manipulated by changing the thickness of material.', 'Also, the composites prepared in this work present microwave absorbing properties similar to the blend based on NBR, EPDM and PAni-DBSA complex [bib38], but with the advantage of no loss of DBSA by exudation as a function of time and better thermal properties.
