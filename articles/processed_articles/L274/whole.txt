Dynamic mechanical behavior of in situ functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube/phenoxy resin compositeIn situ functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT)/Phenoxy composites were prepared by melt mixing Phenoxy with MWNT and 1-(aminopropyl)imidazole (NIm). Composites with 4.8 wt% or more of in situ functionalized MWNT show higher storage modulus than Phenoxy, provided a sufficient amount of NIm was used to aid in the dispersion of the hydrophobic MWNTs in the hydrophilic Phenoxy matrix.['In view of their high axial Young’s moduli and high aspect ratio, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), be it multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) or single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs), are potentially excellent mechanical reinforcing fillers in polymer composites [BIB1]. MWNT-matrix stress transfer was estimated to be at least an order of magnitude more efficient than in conventional fiber-based composites [BIB2]. However, to develop high performance CNT/polymer composites, the challenges often lie in the achievement of homogeneous dispersion of CNTs in polymer matrices and strong interfacial interactions so as to effect efficient load transfer from the polymer matrix to the CNTs.
 The weak interactions between the inner and outer tubes of MWNTs, which limit stress transfer from outer MWNT walls to the inner ones, and the weak interactions between the individual SWNTs that often exist as bundles in a polymer matrix are other factors affecting the efficiency of CNTs as reinforcing fillers [BIB3 BIB4].', 'Most commonly, CNT/polymer composites were prepared by solution casting [BIB5 BIB6 BIB7 BIB8 BIB9 BIB10]. Spin casting [BIB7] and melt spinning (from as-cast composites) [BIB8] have also been used to produce MWNT/polystyrene films and SWNT/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) fibers with fairly aligned CNT.
 However, high-energy sonication of the CNT suspensions over prolonged periods of time [BIB5 BIB6 BIB7 BIB8] or the use of ultrasonic head [BIB9] is usually necessary to produce uniformly dispersed CNT suspensions, before they are subsequently mixed with polymer solutions.
 Shaffer and Windle [BIB10], on the other hand, introduced charges on the CNTs to produce an electrostatically stabilized dispersion of CNTs in water upon sonication.
', 'Besides direct mixing of CNTs and pre-formed polymers in solutions, CNTs had been copolymerized with methyl methacrylate [BIB11 BIB12]. They had also been cured with urethane/diacrylate oligomer [BIB2] or epoxy resins precursors [BIB13 BIB14]. In some cases, good dispersion of SWNTs in the epoxy resin was aided by sonication over a prolonged period of time [BIB14]. Fracture analysis of some of these composites by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [BIB2 BIB12 BIB13] revealed that the resin wetted the CNTs reasonably well, suggesting significant interfacial interactions.
 The use of surfactant [BIB14] had also been demonstrated to improve dispersion and strengthen the interactions between the MWNT and the epoxy resin.
 Recently, carbon nanotube/polymer composites were also prepared by the melt-mixing method [BIB15 BIB16 BIB17].', 'We have recently reported that functionalized C60 is a more effective reinforcing filler than unfunctionalized C60 [BIB18 BIB19]. Moreover, theoretical studies suggested that functionalization of CNTs would not greatly decrease its strength [BIB20]. Hence, we seek to explore the possibility of using physical interactions between chemically functionalized MWNTs and the polymer matrix to produce strong interfacial interactions.
 The functionalization of MWNTs as well as SWNTs has been extensively studied recently [BIB21 BIB22 BIB23 BIB24 BIB25 BIB26 BIB27 BIB28 BIB29 BIB30 BIB31]. A recent work by Mitchell et al. [BIB24] demonstrated that functionalized SWNTs dispersed better in polystyrene nanocomposites, resulting in higher storage modulus at a low filler concentration.
 Geng et al. [BIB25] similarly reported that fluorinated SWNTs could very effectively reinforce poly(ethylene oxide) at a low filler concentration of 4 wt%. In this study, we attempted to functionalize chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown MWNT with 1-(aminopropyl)-imidazole (NIm) in situ by melt-mixing with Phenoxy resin [poly(hydroxyether of bisphenol A)] to produce Im-MWNT/Phenoxy composites.
 The dynamic mechanical behavior of the composites was investigated.
 We have previously found that poly(1-vinylimidazole) undergoes hydrogen bonding interaction with Phenoxy [BIB32]. It is envisaged that the imidazole moieties present in MWNT would similarly interact with the hydroxyl groups of Phenoxy, leading to a better dispersion and stronger interfacial interaction.

[['In situ functionalization of MWNT by NIm', ['Since aniline reacts directly with carbon nanotubes [BIB34] and C60 undergoes multiple additions with amines [BIB35], it is envisaged that the amino group of NIm is likely to react with MWNTs, especially at the defect sites.
 The XPS spectrum of Im-MWNT shows the existence of a pair of N 1s twin-peaks separated by about 2 eV, characteristics of the imidazole moiety, suggesting that in situ functionalization of the MWNT by the NIm has occurred.
 However, the level of functionalization is very low, resulting in high noise level in the N 1s XPS spectrum.
 In fact, although in very low abundance, shortened MWNTs were found in the supernatant solution of W15-20 from the TEM study ([FIG1]). These MWNTs, with a diameter of 50–80 nm, were thicker than pristine MWNTs, which had diameter from 20–30 nm.
']], ['Dynamic mechanical properties of phenoxy/Im-MWNT composites', [['Effect of MWNT content', ['When the NIm content in the Phenoxy/Im-MWNT was maintained at around 2 wt% while the MWNT content was varied, the storage modulus (<i>E</i>   ′) of the composite increased with increasing MWNT concentration from 1.5 to 6.7 wt%. Particularly, at temperature close to or higher than the glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>   g) of the composite, indicated by a peak in the loss modulus, the presence of more MWNTs is able to impart greater stiffness to the polymer matrix ([FIG2]   ). For instance, at around 96 °C, the <i>E</i>   ′ of the composite with 6.7 wt% MWNT is five times greater than that without filler.
 Similar observations had been made by Shaffer and Windle [BIB10] as well as by us [BIB15]. Nevertheless, the use of larger amounts of MWNT at 12.1 wt% (W1-10) and 17.4 wt% (W1-20) does not further improve the storage modulus of the composite in the glassy state.
 Although we managed to disperse 26 wt% raw MWNT in PMMA by melt mixing [BIB15], the difference in the nature of the polymer matrix, Phenoxy being more hydrophilic, could be the reason for the poor dispersion of the hydrophobic MWNTs.
 The <i>E</i>″ peak also moves to a higher temperature with increasing MWNT content ([FIG3]   ). Evidently, MWNTs restrict the segmental motions of the polymer chains in the composites, resulting in a higher <i>T</i>   g.
 Indeed, the storage modulus at room temperature of Phenoxy/Im-MWNT composite increases with increasing NIm content ([FIG4]   , left).', 'As discussed earlier, in situ functionalization of MWNT has occurred.
 Improvement in the interfacial adhesion is also suggested by the decrease in the (tan <i>δ</i>)max value with increasing NIm content in the composite ([FIG4], right).', 'The inclusion of increasing amount of NIm also depresses the <i>T</i>   g of the composite as the unreacted NIm acts as a plasticizer.
 Nevertheless, the depression can be remedied by the incorporation of more MWNTs in the composite, which in turn bring about an improvement in the storage modulus (compare d and e in [FIG4], left).']]]]].
