Functionalisation effect on the thermo-mechanical behaviour of multi-wall carbon nanotube/epoxy-compositesFunctionalisation of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) influences the thermo-mechanical properties of MWCNT/epoxy-composites. Samples based on epoxy resin and different weight percentage of MWCNTs (functionalised and non-functionalised) were prepared. The investigation of the thermo-mechanical behaviour was performed by dynamic-mechanic thermal analysis (DMTA). A dependence of the nanotube content on the glass transition temperature <i>T</i>
                     g was observed. An increase in the amount of nanotubes led to an increase of <i>T</i>
                     g. Samples containing functionalised nanotubes showed a stronger influence on <i>T</i>
                     g in comparison to composites containing the same amount of non-functionalised nanotubes. These results prove the influence of a functionalisation of carbon nanotubes on the interfacial interaction between the polymer and CNT.['Since the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991 by Iijima [BIB1] most of the research activities focussed more on the evaluation of nanotube properties themselves as well as their high potential as nano-structured filler for polymer composites and the expected novel material properties.
 The unique mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes, their high strength and stiffness and the enormous aspect ratio make them a potential structural element for the improvement of (fracture-) mechanical properties [BIB2 BIB3 BIB4 BIB5 BIB6]. Further potential advantages, which promote nanotubes as ultimate fillers for polymers, are their electrical and thermal conductivity together with a low density [BIB7].', "These expectations concerning a mechanical reinforcement were preliminarily based on the theoretical prediction of extreme high values for fracture strength and Young's modulus [BIB8 BIB9 BIB10 BIB11]. An experimental determination of the stress–strain behaviour of individual carbon nanotubes resulted in values between 11 and 63 GPa for the strength and 270–950 GPa for the Young's modulus [BIB12 BIB13]. These values were lower than the theoretical predictions, but nevertheless, due to their extreme aspect ratio, an increase in fracture toughness and a moderate increase in strength and Young's modulus can be estimated.
", 'A mechanical reinforcement of polymers by carbon nanotubes can only be realised by solving two main problems: (i) the dispersion of the nanotubes and (ii) the interfacial adhesion between the nanotubes and the matrix.
 First experimental work focusing on the interfacial interaction in MWCNT/epoxy-nanocomposites was performed by Cooper et al. [BIB14]. They investigated the detachment of MWCNTs from an epoxy matrix.
 In a special pull-out test for individual nanotubes, values for the interfacial shear strength were found to be in the range between 35 and 376 MPa.
 Recently, Wagner reported the value of 50 MPa for the interfacial shear strength.
 Further investigations on the nanotube/polymer-interactions had been performed by Barber et al. [BIB15]. They observed a surface-size dependence of the pull-out forces in a polyethylene–butene matrix with MWCNTs.
 These tests could substantiate the reinforcing effect of nanotubes.
 Progress in reinforcing polymers with carbon nanotubes has recently been reported for rubbery epoxy matrices and multi-wall carbon nanotubes [BIB16 BIB17].', 'The realisation of nanotube-reinforced epoxies requires, besides a homogenous dispersion, a strong interfacial interaction between the nanotubes and the polymer.
 We suppose that the use of MWCNTs as reinforcing elements in tough epoxy matrices is hindered by weak interfacial interactions.
 A stress-induced deformation of the composite would lead to a failure of the nanotube/epoxy-interface and finally to pull-out.
 A further enhancement of the compatibility to the composite material could be achieved by a chemical functionalisation of the carbon nanotube surface, through covalent or ionic bonds to the polymeric matrix.
 These bonds enable a stress transfer between the polymer and the CNTs which leads to improved interfacial interactions as qualitatively determined previously [BIB18]. Samples containing amino-functionalised arc-grown nanotubes in a comparable epoxy system ([FIG1] ) revealed the improved interfacial interaction.
 Telescopic pull-outs were observed where the outermost layer that is directly bonded to the matrix, remains in the matrix, while the inner-tubes bridge the pore.
', 'Frankland et al. [BIB19] confirmed the influence of a functionalisation on the interfacial adhesion by simulations which predict that a functionalisation of less then one percent would improve the interaction between nanotubes and the polymer without decreasing their strength significantly.
', 'In the present work, a new method to homogeneously disperse carbon nanotubes in an epoxy matrix is proposed.
 Furthermore the evaluation of the influence of carbon nanotubes and especially the functionalisation effect on the thermo-mechanical properties are presented.
'].
 Our dispersion process, described elsewhere [BIB18 BIB20] could be further improved.
 [FIG3]  shows the observed dispersion in a representative section of a sample containing amino-functionalised nanotubes.
 The importance of a homogeneous dispersion can be deduced from the pattern of the fracture surfaces of two samples each containing 0.25 wt% amino-functionalised nanotubes ([FIG4] ). The dispersion of the nanotubes in the sample (4a) was achieved by sonicating the nanotubes in acetone, mixing the suspension with the epoxy resin and evaporating the solvent, while sample (4b) was prepared as described in the experimental section.
 The nanotubes in sample (4b) are randomly distributed.
 As it can be seen in [FIG4] the fracture surface has a hexagonal pattern and still contains small agglomerates.
 The samples manufactured by the method described in [SEC1] did neither show agglomerates nor a fracture pattern which gives evidences for an initiation of failure.
', '[FIG5]  show the results of the dynamic measurements of storage modulus and loss factor as a function of temperature.
', 'Besides the reported influence on the elastic properties, the loss modulus <i>E</i>″ increased at 0.05 wt%, followed by a continous decrease in the peak height at higher CNT-contents ([FIG6] ). The dispersed nanotubes dissipate energy due to resistance against visco-elastic deformation of the surrounding epoxy matrix.
 The <i>T</i> g was shifted from 64 °C for the neat resin, to 80 °C for samples containing 0.75 wt% MWCNTs, respectively 83 °C for samples containing 0.75 wt% amino-functionalised MWCNTs.
 Shaffer et al. [BIB21] described this effect for semicrystalline poly(vinyl alcohol)/nanotube composites.
 They showed a moderate influence in the case of PVA/MWCNT-nanocomposites containing up to 60 wt% carbon nanotubes, but predicted a strong effect for amorphous matrices, as observed in our case.
 The data shown in [FIG7]  represent the maxima of the loss modulus acquired from the dynamic measurements.
 [FIG8]  shows DSC-curves measured for the neat epoxy and two samples containing each 0.75 wt% carbon nanotubes (functionalised and non-functionalised). No exothermic post-curing peaks around 140 °C were observed in the materials investigated.
