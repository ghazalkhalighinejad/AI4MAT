Electrical conductivity and dielectric properties of PMMA/expanded graphite compositesPMMA/expanded graphite (EG) composites were prepared by direct solution blending of PMMA with the expanded graphite filler. Electrical conductivity and dielectric properties of the composites were measured by a four-point probe resistivity determiner and a dielectric analyzer (DEA). Interestingly, only 1 wt.% filler content was required to reach the percolation threshold (<i>φ</i>) of transition in electrical conductivity from an insulator to a semiconductor using PMMA/EG. The thickness of the interlayer of the expanded graphite was shown to be close to the nanometer scale. The reported filler content was much lower than that required for conventional PMMA/carbon black (8 wt.% carbon) and PMMA/graphite (3.5 wt.% graphite) composites. The improvements in both electrical conductivity and structural integrity were attributed to the difference in filler geometry (aspect ratio and surface area) and the formation of conductive networks in the composites.['Recent interest in low-<i>K</i> dielectric packaging materials and conductive polymers have created new incentives in blending an engineered proportion of functional and light-weight mechanical components to form unique material systems.
 Conductive composites offer functional applications in addition to mechanical improvement for load-bearing applications.
 In the different composite systems under consideration, nanocomposites give rise to excellent physical properties in addition to conductive and mechanical performance.
 Nanocomposites are a new class of materials containing at least one filler dimension in the nanometer range [BIB1]. Based on the filler geometries, nanocomposites can be classified into three primary categories.
 Fumed silica dioxide and nanometallic powder are particles, which are characterized by three dimensions in the nanometer range [BIB2 BIB3]. Carbon nanotube and whiskers possess two dimensions in the nanometer range [BIB4 BIB5], whereas clay, mica and expanded graphite layered structural fillers [BIB1 BIB6 BIB7 BIB8] possess only one dimension in the nanometer range.
 Among the latter, smectite clay in platelet form has been widely studied [BIB1] because the natural materials are easily available and the intercalation chemistry is reasonably well understood in the literature.
 The nanocomposites containing layered silicates exhibit markedly superior mechanical, thermal and barrier performance in comparison with conventional microcomposites [BIB1 BIB6 BIB7 BIB8 BIB9 BIB10]. Unfortunately, nanoclay reinforced polymers do not possess electrical conductivity, photonic and dielectric properties that are as good as some functional polymers such as graphite-containing polymers.
', 'Different conductive fillers such as carbon black (CB) and metallic powder have been extensively explored for composite components.
 These fillers effectively improve the conductivity of polymers [BIB3 BIB11 BIB12 BIB13]. Usually rather high filler content is needed to increase the conductivity because the filler size is only in the micrometer range.
 The significant improvement in electrical conductivity arising from the increase of filler content was observed for most composites and it was explained by the percolation transition of the conductive network formation.
 The percolation values for a critical transition in filler-based composites are 8 wt.
% for PMMA/CB [BIB11], 6.2 wt.
% for PP/CB [BIB11] and 9 wt.
% for nylon 6/CB [BIB12]. In most cases, relatively large quantities of fillers were needed to reach the critical percolation value.
', 'Natural graphite flakes provide good electrical conductivity (106 S/m at ambient temperature) and layered structure with a c-axis lattice constant, which indicates interplanar spacing, of 0.66 nm [BIB14]. Since there are no reactive ion groups on the graphite layers, it is difficult to prepare the polymer/graphite nanocomposites via ion exchange reaction in order to intercalate the monomers into the graphite sub-layers.
 The expanded graphite, however, contains abundant multi-pores ranging from 2 nm to 10 μm.
 Average size of the pores is about 2 μm.
 The graphite maintains a layered structure similar to natural flake graphite but with larger layer spacing [BIB14 BIB15 BIB16 BIB17]. Recently, it was reported that markedly lower volume fraction of expanded graphite was able to reach the percolation threshold of conductivity in nylon 6/graphite and PS/graphite nanocomposites by in situ polymerization of polymer matrix [BIB7 BIB8]. In these graphite-based nanocomposites, the monomer was first introduced into the pores of the expanded graphite to be followed by polymerization.
', 'The expanded graphite has a higher volume expansion ratio than that of regular graphite.
 Furthermore, the multi-pores, functional acids and the OH groups will facilitate physical and chemical adsorption between the graphite and the polymer solution [BIB14 BIB16 BIB17]. In this paper, we prepared the PMMA/graphite nanocomposites by the solution blending method.
 After dissolving the polymer, the expanded graphite was mixed with the polymer solution.
 The polymers were then locked into the pores of the expanded graphite and remained in it after solvent extraction.
 The morphologies of the materials were examined using SEM.
 The electrical and dielectric properties of the graphite composites were determined and discussed as a function of expanded graphite content.
 The mechanical properties of the polymer/graphite composites were investigated by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA).'].
[['Structural characteristics of expanded graphite (EG)', ["In the presence of an oxidizer, which is concentrated nitric acid in this work, the intercalant, which is concentrated sulfuric acid, is dispersed into the graphite layers to form graphite intercalating compounds (GIC), see [FIGGR1]. After rapid expansion of GIC at a high temperature, EG was formed.
 The expansion volume ratio of EG to natural graphite was 50–100. The structure of EG was strongly affected by experimental conditions such as temperature, oxidizer's concentration, intercalating time, etc.
 [FIGGR2] shows the SEM photomicrographs of untreated graphite ([FIGGR2]) and expanded graphite ([FIGGR2]). The differences in microstructures between the two different fillers can be clearly noted.
 [FIGGR2] reveals the loose structures of expanded graphite whereas [FIGGR2] display the photomicrographs of the loose structures in successively larger magnifications.
 Evidently, loose structures containing multi-pores in the EG could be observed in [FIGGR2]. For the EG prepared by the chemical method, the average pore diameter is about 2 μm.
 The surface area per gram is roughly 30–40 m2/g and the pore volume is about 4–8 ml/g [BIB16 BIB17]. [FIGGR2] also suggests the thickness of the EG layer is less than 100 nm.
 For the EG, only the spacing of the graphite layers was expanded; the conductive characteristics of each EG sheet layer remains the same as graphite flakes themselves by nature [BIB18]. The graphite expansion would certainly influence the overall conductivity of the bulk materials.
 In addition, some functional groups such as –OH, –COOH groups existed on the surface and pores of the EG after acid and high temperature treatments and they could promote the adsorption of molecular chains and monomers onto the pores [BIB17]. To summarize, the high surface area and the prevalent pores in EG facilitate the processing and formation of in situ polymer/EG composites.
"]], ['Electrical conductivity of PMMA/graphite composites', ['[FIGGR3] shows the electrical conductivity of PMMA/graphite vs.
 The conductivity of the materials is about 10−16 S/cm in the initial stage and this is consistent with the magnitude of an insulator.
 At this stage, the conductivity of the material is about 10−4 S/cm for PMMA/EG and 10−5 S/cm for PMMA/graphite, which is nearly consistent with that of a semiconductor.
 Similar result was reported in HDPE/graphite composites with different filler size [BIB19]. The electrical conductivity of the composites exhibited a pronounced transition with the increase of filler content, from an insulator to nearly a semiconductor.
 This transition can be satisfactorily explained and described by the percolation theory and the formation of the conductive network in the composites [BIB8]. According to the theory, the percolation threshold (<i>φ</i>) corresponds to the onset of the transition from an insulator to a semiconductor.
 For the PMMA/graphite composites, <i>φ</i> ≈3.5 wt.
% graphite but <i>φ</i> ≈1 wt.
 In contrast, PMMA/CB conductive composites require <i>φ</i> ≈8 wt.
 The aspect ratio is about 50–100 with a thickness of 10–20 μm as observed in the SEM.
', 'As shown in [FIGGR4], the graphite layer is expanded and it could also be seen in the presence of polymer.
 The thickness is estimated to be less than 100 nm.
 Using parallel plate electrodes, the loss factor (<i>e</i>″) can be calculated as follows: (1)  e″=d 2πRAfeo   where <i>A</i>=electrode plate area, <i>R</i>=electrical resistance, <i>d</i>=plate spacing, <i>f</i>=frequency and <i>e</i>   <i>o</i>=absolute permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F/m). So the loss factor is related to the conductance (1/R).', '[FIGGR5] shows the loss factor, <i>e</i>″, obtained from the PMMA/graphite and PMMA/EG composites as a function of temperature and frequency using the DEA.
 PMMA alone shows very low <i>e</i>″ values (about 0.1) at all frequencies as indicated in [FIGGR5]. The change in <i>e</i>″ with temperature shows the typical characteristics of an insulator.
 The results for PMMA containing 3 wt.
% EG are shown in [FIGGR5]. The curves show much higher <i>e</i>″ values (about 108 at 1 Hz) and they are constant with temperature change.
 In this case PMMA/EG composites derived from [FD1] display comparable conductivity to a semiconductor.
 Similar trends are shown for PMMA/graphite composites at higher filler content (5 wt.
%) in [FIGGR5]. However, the <i>e</i>″ values for unexpanded PMMA/graphite are slightly lower than those pertaining to PMMA/EG.
 [FIGGR6] shows the variation of <i>e</i>″ with different filler content for PMMA/graphite and PMMA/EG at 1Hz.
 Clearly, the same conclusion can be drawn from <i>e</i>″ trends in [FIGGR6] as that drawn the electrical conductivity in [FIGGR3]. PMMA/EG reaches the percolation threshold at a markedly lower filler content than that for PMMA/graphite.
', 'The variation of <i>e</i>″ for PMMA/graphite composites with temperature at a given filler content is shown in [FIGGR7]. A sharp increase in <i>e</i>″ takes place at around 80\xa0°C at different frequencies.
 The increase in the electrical conductivity of the composite as temperature increases above the <i>T</i>g of the PMMA matrix, as revealed in [FIGGR10], can be caused by the possible flocculation of conductive fillers.
 As noted earlier, the PMMA/EG reached the percolation threshold at 1 wt.
 The storage modulus (<i>G</i>′), loss modulus (<i>G</i>″) and tan\xa0<i>δ</i> of PMMA/graphite and PMMA/EG from room temperature to 100\xa0°C are shown in [FIGGR8 FIGGR9 FIGGR10], respectively, as a function of filler content.
 The results for the PMMA/graphite indicated that <i>G</i>′ ([FIGGR8]) and <i>G</i>″ ([FIGGR9]) are close to that of pure PMMA.
 But the glass transition temperature, <i>T</i>   <i>g</i>, of the composites is shifted to higher temperatures than that of pure PMMA, as indicated by the shift of tan\xa0<i>δ</i> in [FIGGR10]. This observation is ascribed to the restricted segmental movement upon the addition of fillers [BIB20]. The results appear consistent with the behavior of other filled polymeric systems [BIB20 BIB21].', 'For PMMA/EG composites, however, the DMA results in Figs.
\xa08b and 9b reveal a completely different pattern from PMMA/graphite composites.
 <i>G</i>′ increases from 2.8 GPa for pure PMMA to 3.4 GPa for PMMA/EG even at a relatively low filler weight fraction (2 wt.
%). Evidently, EG at the nanometer scale can improve the stiffness of the materials even at relatively low filler content, which is consistent with some other nanocomposites [BIB1]. Second, <i>G</i>″, which is indicative of energy dissipation in viscoelastic deformation, of PMMA/EG is also greatly improved upon EG addition.
 <i>G</i>″ increases from 250\xa0MPa of PMMA to 380 MPa of PMMA/EG.
 The tan <i>δ</i> of PMMA/EG composites as shown in [FIGGR10] indicates a shift of <i>T</i>   <i>g</i> to higher values by as much as 10\xa0°C in comparison with pure PMMA.
', '[FIGGR11] plots the <i>G</i>′ for PMMA/graphite and PMMA/EG as a function of filler content at room temperature.
