Rheological and dielectrical characterization of melt mixed polycarbonate-multiwalled carbon nanotube compositesA series of composites of polycarbonate (PC) with 23 different contents of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) was produced by melt mixing using the masterbatch dilution method. In dielectric measurements, AC conductivity and complex permittivity data obtained in the frequency range between 10−3 and 107
                     Hz at room temperature indicated the electrical percolation threshold at about 1.0wt%.
                  The dynamic mode melt rheological measurements for the same samples at eight temperatures between 170 and 280°C showed a visible change in the frequency dependence of dynamic moduli and the absolute value of the complex viscosity |<i>η</i>*| particularly at low frequencies. In literature these changes are sometimes related to so called ‘percolation threshold concentration’. Applying this picture to our experimental data we have to assume that the percolation threshold is strongly dependent on the measurement temperature. It changes from about 5 to 0.5wt% MWNT by increasing the measurement temperature from 170 to 280°C, respectively. This temperature dependence cannot be explained by a classical liquid-solid transition but may be related to the existence of a combined nanotube-polymer network.['The reinforcing influence of active fillers is known to play an important role for improvement of mechanical properties of polymer composites.
 In case of conductive additives the electrical properties of the material are also strongly influenced.
 New opportunities arise by using nanoscaled fillers, especially carbon nanotubes (CNT) which exhibit excellent electrical properties and distinct fibrous shape with very large aspect ratios as high as 1000–10,000. This high aspect ratio allows the formation of a percolated structure at very low volume contents.
 According to theoretical prediction on idealized cylindrical shaped fillers at an aspect ratio of 1000 only 0.05vol.% of filler is necessary for percolation [bib1].', 'Electrical measurements are an unambiguous criterion of the existence of a percolated network in case of conductive fillers in an isolating matrix.
 Dielectric measurements performed with varying frequency can lead to additional information about the percolation network as it was shown for percolation structures of other conductive fillers, e.
g.
 carbon black in polymeric matrices [bib2 bib3 bib4]. Recently, also results on percolated structures of carbon nanotubes in polymers were presented (see e.
g.
 [bib5 bib6 bib7 bib8]). Our group recently presented first results on melt processed polycarbonate–MWNT composites in the frequency range of 10−4 to 107 Hz with the special focus on the influence of melt processing conditions on the dispersion below and above the percolation composition [bib9].', 'Oscillatory melt rheology is known to be a very sensitive method to characterize the structure of polymer melts.
 It is described in literature that interconnected structures of anisometric fillers lead to qualitative changes in the spectra of dynamic moduli and viscosity [bib10 bib11]. The complex viscosity changes from a Newtonian plateau to a continuous decrease with increasing frequency, whereas storage modulus <i>G</i>′ and loss modulus <i>G</i>″ flatten significantly and merge into a secondary plateau at low frequencies.
', 'For carbon nanotube filled polymer composites, as polycarbonate/MWNT composites [bib12] and polyamide 6/MWNT composites [bib13], similar effects have been reported.
 Characteristic changes in the rheological behaviour with increasing nanotube content were found for temperatures well above the glass transition or melting temperature.
 The rheologically determined threshold was related to the electrically measured percolation composition.
 The changes in frequency dependences of <i>G</i>′, <i>G</i>″,tan  δ  and/or |<i>η</i>*| with increasing nanotube content were discussed in the frame of liquid-to-solid or liquid-to-gel transitions as introduced by Winter et al. [bib14]. Although the rheological data for CNT-polymer composites represent the general feature of a liquid-to-solid transition the situation seems to be somewhat more complicated, and the specific interactions between the percolation structures formed by the CNT and the temporary entanglement network of the polymer matrix should be taken into consideration.
', 'The aim of this paper is to give some experimental evidences for the interaction between CNT and the ‘physical network’ formed by entangled polymer chains.
 Furthermore, the relation between the electrical percolation threshold, which is assumed to be mainly related to the geometrical percolation of the nanotubes, and the changes in the frequency dependent rheological properties with increasing CNT content will be discussed.
', 'For this purpose, the rheological measurements were performed in a quite broad temperature range with composites in which the CNT content was varied in very small steps around the electrical percolation threshold.
 Due to the temperature variation it was possible to change the viscoelastic behaviour of the polymer matrix systematically whereas the CNT network was expected to remain almost unchanged.

[['Dielectric measurements', ['[fig1] shows real part of the permittivity (<i>ε</i>′) and real part of the conductivity (<i>σ</i>′) as function of frequency for different MWNT content.
 Due to the high DC conductivity of the samples with contents higher than 1.375wt% MWNT, it was not possible to measure reasonable values of <i>ε</i>′ for these composites.
 According to [fig1], the samples can be separated into two groups.
 The composites with MWNT content lower than 1.0wt% have a nearly constant <i>ε</i>′ value, whereas composites with MWNT loading ≥1.0wt% show a significantly different frequency behaviour.
 The percolation composition, <i>p</i>c, is clearly indicated to be between 0.875 and 1.0wt%. Between these compositions the low-frequency conductivity changes significantly (over more than 7 decades). Composites with MWNT contents ≥1.0wt% show a clear DC plateau up to some critical frequency <i>f</i>c above which conductivity increase with a power law.
', '[fig2] shows the extrapolated values of the DC conductivity (<i>σ</i>DC=<i>σ</i>′(<i>f</i>→0)) versus the MWNT content for the composites above the percolation threshold.
', 'In order to get an estimate for <i>p</i>c we fitted the experimental <i>σ</i>DC data for <i>p</i>><i>p</i>c to equation: (1)  σ DC   (p)∝ (  p  −   p c)  t  which represents the well known scaling law for the composite conductivity for <i>p</i>><i>p</i>c near the percolation threshold [bib17 bib18 bib19]. The best linear fit for <i>σ</i>DC vs.
 (<i>p</i>−<i>p</i>c) data on a log–log scale was found for the percolation concentration <i>p</i>c about 0.99wt% and critical exponent <i>t</i>=3.8 (see inset in [fig2]). The solid curve on the [fig2] was calculated from Eq.
 [fd1] using the fit values of <i>p</i>c and <i>t</i>. The value of <i>t</i>=3.8 is higher than the universal 3D lattice value (<i>t</i>∼2) [bib17 bib18 bib19] and also higher than the value predicted by the mean-field model (<i>t</i>∼3) [bib20].']], ['Melt rheology', ['As a representative example the frequency dependence of the shear storage modulus <i>G</i>′, the loss modulus <i>G</i>″,  tanδ  =   G ″/   G ′ , and the absolute value of the complex viscosity |<i>η</i>*| (<i>η</i>*=<i>η</i>′−i<i>η</i>″) are shown in log–log plots in [fig3] for a temperature of 220°C.
 In [fig4], the <i>G</i>′ versus frequency curves are compared for 170 and 280°C, respectively.
 In [fig5] the |<i>η</i>*| vs.
', 'It is clearly seen in [fig3 fig4], that the addition of MWNT to PC leads to an increase in <i>G</i>′. This effect is represented for all temperatures studied.
 At 170°C, <i>G</i>′ changes over about 2 decades by adding 15wt% MWNT, whereas at 280°C, <i>G</i>′ changes over nearly 5 decades by adding 15wt% MWNT.
 It is interesting that at 170°C no significant changes in the frequency dependence of the moduli and complex viscosity at low frequency can be detected up to 4wt% MWNT.
 Starting from 5wt% MWNT, a plateau is found at low frequencies in <i>G</i>′ and a pronounced shear thinning behaviour is noticeable in |<i>η</i>*|. Those changes can be found starting from 1.125 and 0.5wt% MWNT at 220 and 280°C, respectively ([fig3 fig4 fig5]).', 'In order to check thermally induced changes in the PC base material during the measurements over such a broad temperature range, the time–temperature superposition principle was used to create a mastercurve.
 The data measured for the neat PC between 150 and 280°C were shifted into a master curve at a reference temperature of <i>T</i>0=170°C using the ARES software.
 This principle is described by Williams-Landel-Ferry [bib21] as: (2)   log   a   T= −   c 1(  T  −   T 0) c 2+  (  T  −   T 0) where <i>a</i>T is the empirically derived horizontal shift factor and the constants <i>c</i>1 and <i>c</i>2 are material specific.
 In addition, the data were shifted in the vertical direction using the vertical shift factor given by   b T=  ρ  T  /   ρ 0 T 0 , where <i>ρ</i> is the material density.
 As shown in [fig6], the master curve reveals no evidence of thermal degradation during the long thermo-mechanical history of the measuring.
 Their frequency dependencies at very low frequencies range are as follow: <i>G</i>′∼<i>ω</i>1.8; <i>G</i>″∼<i>ω</i>0.94. These relaxation exponents are less than the expected from the theory (<i>G</i>′∼<i>ω</i>2; <i>G</i>″∼<i>ω</i>1), but this is accepted for such kind of commercial materials having large molecular weight distribution.
