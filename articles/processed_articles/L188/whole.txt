Viscoelastic properties and thermal degradation kinetics of silica/PMMA nanocompositesPMMA-silica nanocomposites were prepared using a bulk polymerization technique. Three organic silica groups, two modified with methyl groups and the third an octane, made these inorganic silica particles more hydrophobic. These silica/PMMA nanocomposites exhibited higher storage and loss moduli than those of pristine PMMA. The <i>T</i>
                     g of these composites increased with the silica content. The thermal characteristics of these composites were also enhanced by incorporating silica into the PMMA matrix. The degradation temperature at 10% weight loss was approximately 30°C higher than that of pristine PMMA, depending upon the silica content. The rate of weight loss at 220°C for 2h was also markedly reduced in the presence of these modified silicas. The results might be attributed to “trapping effect”. The activation energies for these silica/PMMA nanocomposites were enhanced according to Flynn, Ozawa–Flynn, and Kissinger methods.['Recently, the potential of using inorganic minerals as fillers in polymeric composites has become appreciated in areas of commercial and scientific application, and many investigations have been published [BIB1 BIB2 BIB3 BIB4 BIB5 BIB6 BIB7]. The mechanical and thermal properties of inorganic/organic nanocomposites are expected to be considerably improved when the largest possible inorganic surface area is presented to the matrix.
 To achieve this improvement, the fillers must be fully dispersed throughout, and connected to the matrix using an appropriately modified intermediary to increase the hydrophobicity of the inorganic composites [BIB8]. Silica particles, however, are difficult to disperse in organic solvent without surfactant because they tend to form large aggregations.
', 'This work concerns the problem of silica particle dispersion and demonstrates a route to prevent the aggregation of silica by modifying silica surface.
 These modified silica particles disperse well among various monomers to form inorganic/polymer nanocomposites.
 Moreover, organically modified silica makes inorganic components more hydrophobic, causing them to disperse effectively throughout organic solvent or polymer matrices.
 Therefore, inorganic/organic nanocomposites without aggregated inorganic components in the polymer phases are obtained.
 Briefly, the organic modification of inorganic components is the most important process prior to the preparation of inorganic/polymer nanocomposites.
', 'This study examines the bulk polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA). AEROSIL® R805, R812 and R972 were used as the three modified silicas, which were treated with amorphous silica, as indicated in [FIG1] . Numerous inorganic/PMMA nanocomposites have recently been investigated [BIB9 BIB10 BIB11 BIB12 BIB13 BIB14 BIB15], and found to exhibit some properties superior to those of pure PMMA.
 Silicas are commercially available and the effects between a modified silica surface and the PMMA matrix have been studied to improve their utility, related to mechanical properties, hardness and surface abrasion.
', 'Reliable kinetic parameters for the thermal degradation of silica/PMMA nanocomposites are determined.
 Even if the degradation has been extensively studied [BIB16 BIB17 BIB18 BIB19 BIB20 BIB21 BIB22 BIB23 BIB24], there are lots of investigations for the thermal degradation of inorganic/PMMA composites.
 Most researchers have examined layered silicate composites or the use of in situ sol–gel processes to improve interactions to prepare silica/PMMA nanocomposites.
 The relationships between the properties of the polymer and the content of modifying silica are interesting.
 This paper describes a simple approach that involves adding modified silica to MMA solution to generate the silica/PMMA composites, and considers the relationships between the modified silica surface and the PMMA matrix, and mechanical and thermal behaviors.

[['Viscoelastic properties of modified silica/PMMA nanocomposites', ['[FIG3 FIG4] plot the storage modulus (<i>E</i>′) and loss modulus (<i>E</i>″) of silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites, obtained by DMA measurement.
 The storage moduli of the silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites at about 40°C are improved by introducing rigid silica particles.
 The loss modulus of silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites at around 50°C also increases with the silica content because of the friction between the modified silica particles and the PMMA molecules when the silica particles are thoroughly dispersed in the PMMA matrix.
 The results reveal that the silica-R805 excellently reinforces the mechanical properties of pristine PMMA.
 The maximum <i>E</i>″ in [FIG4] indicates that <i>T</i>g of the silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites increased with the silica content.
', '[FIG5] plots the dependence of tan<i>δ</i> on temperature for silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites.
 Increasing the silica content also broadens the tan<i>δ</i> peak, and lowers its intensity from 1.5 to 1.1. The breadth of the tan<i>δ</i> peak relates to the relaxation of the polymer chain.
 Hence, the breadth of the tan<i>δ</i> peak increases with the silica content, and the height of the tan<i>δ</i> peak measures the energy-damping characteristics of a material. The silica particles are well dispersed in the PMMA matrix, so the rigid silica particles directly enhance the stiffness of the silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites.
', '[FIG6] plots the relationship between the storage modulus of the variously modified silica/PMMA nanocomposites and the silica content.
 Additionally, the moduli increased by about 30%, 40% and 56% for silica-R972/PMMA, silica-R812/PMMA and silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites, respectively, at a silica loading of 4 wt%. The silica-R805/PMMA composite has higher storage modulus than silica-R812/PMMA and silica-R972/PMMA composites, perhaps because the silica-R805 particles can be more easily dispersed effectively in the PMMA matrix, causing stronger interactions than the other two modified silicas, increasing the elastic modulus of the materials.
', '[FIG7] reveals the maximum of the loss modulus of these modified silica/PMMA nanocomposites.
 It can be observed that the loss modulus of the silica-R805/PMMA increases slightly with loading up to 2 wt%, and then rises rapidly as silica is added beyond 2 wt%. Unlike those of the other two composites, silica-R812/PMMA and silica-R972/PMMA, the loss modulus increases smoothly.
 The phenomena may be attributed to the increase in the friction between the modified silica-R805 surface group (octane) and the PMMA molecules with the silica-R805 content above 2 wt%, and the fact that the interactions between the other two methyl groups on the modified silica-R812 and -R972 are weaker, even as the silica content is increased to 4 wt%.', '[FIG8] plots the relationship between the glass transition temperature (<i>T</i>g) of the differently modified silica/PMMA nanocomposites and the silica content.
 The <i>T</i>g of the silica-R805/PMMA composites increases from 113°C to 131°C as the silica loading increases to 4 wt%, while that of the silica-R812/PMMA and silica-R972 increases from 113°C to 126°C and 125°C, respectively.
 [FIG9] displays the SEM micrographs of the cross-sections of silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites, and the silica particles dispersed in the PMMA matrix in the case of 1–4 wt% silica loading.
 The particles are sized between 70nm and 110nm.
 [FIG10] displays two different modified silica/PMMA composites and unmodified silica/PMMA composites with 4 wt% loading.
 A comparison with [FIG9 FIG10] clearly indicates that silica-R805 particles can disperse effectively in the PMMA matrix, but other kinds of silica (R812, R972 and unmodified silica) begin to aggregate into large silica particles.
 Therefore, the silica-R805/PMMA nanocomposites have a higher storage modulus and loss modulus than silica-R812/PMMA and silica-R972/PMMA.
 [FIG11] shows the TGA weight loss and derivative thermograms (DTG) for organically modified silica in an atmosphere of nitrogen.
 The major differences between these organic silicas arise in the temperature range 400–600°C—especially for silica-R805. The weight lost by the modified silica-R972 is very low between 50°C and 600°C.
 Any peaks in a derivative plot of this region reveal the presence of organic material. The organic constituent in organic silica-R805 starts to decompose at around 400°C, and the maximum in the derivative curve is at 525°C.
 Thus, the thermal stabilities of the modified silica are in the order R972>R812>R805.', '[FIG12] displays typical dynamic thermogravimetric TGA weight loss and derivative thermograms for variously modified silica/PMMA composites with 1 wt% added silica in a nitrogen environment.
 The thermal stability of pristine PMMA is related to the “weak links” in the radical-polymerized PMMA as the principal initiation sites of degradation [BIB20 BIB21 BIB22]. The second steps in degradation of PMMA are attributed to the presence of head-to-head linkages, the lack of saturation of the end groups related to the combination and termination of two radicals and random scission.
 Interestingly, silica-R972/PMMA nanocomposite is more thermally stable than the other modified silica/PMMA nanocomposites, but does not have the most favorable mechanical characteristics.
 Therefore, the silica-R805/PMMA has the most favorable mechanical properties and the silica-R972/PMMA is the most thermally stable.
', 'Aruchamy et al. [BIB30] and Morgan et al. [BIB31] also observed that unmodified silica/PMMA composites have higher decomposition temperatures than pure PMMA.
 Morgan et al. explained their results by the “trapping effect” of SiO2 particles on the degradation products.
 Aruchamy and others [BIB30 BIB32 BIB33 BIB34] proposed that a hydrogen-bonding interaction between carbonyl groups in PMMA and Si–OH groups on silica surfaces may explain the improved stability.
', '[FIG13] plots the isothermal thermogravimetric curves for silica/PMMA nanocomposites variously modified at 220°C for 2h.
 Clearly, the silica-R972/PMMA composites have greater thermal resistance than other composites.
', '[FIG14] indicates the effect of modified silica content on the thermal decomposition temperature at 5% and 10% weight loss of the composites.
 The temperature of degradation at 10% weight loss is approximately 20–30°C higher than that of pure PMMA.
 Above 2 wt% silica loading, the decomposition temperature of these composites remains almost constant, perhaps because few silica particles are aggregated in the PMMA matrix.
']], ['Thermal degradation kinetics', ['The activation energy (<i>E</i>a) of degradation can be determined using the methods of Flynn [BIB25 BIB26 BIB27], Kissinger [BIB27 BIB28 BIB29] and Ozawa–Flynn [BIB25 BIB26 BIB28].', 'Flynn proposed the use of the non-isothermal differential weight loss (DTGA) method at a constant heating rate <i>β</i> to evaluate the activation energy.
 This method is applied to estimate the initial degradation energy between 1 and 5%. [FIG15] plots <i>T</i>2(d<i>X</i>/d<i>T</i>) versus the extent of conversion of PMMA with various modified silica/PMMA composites.
 [TBL1] lists the degradation activation energies of silica/PMMA composites with various silica contents.
 The pure PMMA has average activation energy 55kJ/mol. Three modified silica nanocomposites, silica-R972/PMMA, silica-R812/PMMA and silica-R805/PMMA have activation energies in ranges 75–85kJ/mol, 73–82kJ/mol and 65–74kJ/mol, respectively.
 Thus, the order of effects of the alkyl group on silica surface to the thermal stability of silica/PMMA composites can be concluded as R972∼R812>R805.', 'The second method involves non-isothermal TGA measurement, developed by Kissinger at a constant rate of degradation, to evaluate the average decomposition energy at weight losses between 0 and 20%. A plot of ln[(d<i>x</i>/d<i>T</i>)/(1−<i>x</i>)] against 1/<i>T</i> yields a straight line that fits the data from the decomposition, the gradient of which provides the activation energy.
 [TBL2] summarizes the experimental results.
 The silica/PMMA has a mean activation energy of above 96–126kJ/mol for silica-R972/PMMA, 92–121kJ/mol for silica-R812/PMMA and 85–99kJ/mol for silica-R805/PMMA.
 The pure PMMA system has average activation energy of 72kJ/mol. These results conclude that the silica/PMMA nanocomposite system has a higher activation energy and thermal resistance than pure PMMA.
 A comparison of the ranges of activation energies of the modified silica/PMMA nanocomposites reveals clearly that the thermal stability of the modified silica on PMMA follows the order, silica-R972/PMMA∼-R812/PMMA>-R805/PMMA.
 Thus, from the Kissinger analysis, it seems that the thermal stability of silica-R972/PMMA is slightly superior to silica-R812/PMMA composites, and both are much superior to silica-R805/PMMA.
 Accordingly, a series of experiments were performed at various heating rates, and <i>E</i>a was obtained from the slope of the linear isoconversion plot of ln(heating rate) against 1/<i>T</i>. The lines in [FIG16] are obtained for various conversions.
 The mean activation energies, summarized in [TBL3], are determined from the slopes of the curves.
 The activation energies of 5, 10, 15 and 20% conversions of silica/PMMA are in the range 81–111kJ/mol, while those of pristine PMMA are between 53 and 67kJ/mol. The silica/PMMA nanocomposites are more thermally stable than pure PMMA.
 The activation energy observably increased with percentage weight loss, and the thermal stabilities of the modified silica on PMMA follow the order silica-R972/PMMA∼-R812/PMMA>-R805/PMMA.
 [TBL1] lists the activation energies of the initial degradation process (1–5% weight loss). The degradation proceeds as the temperature rises.
 [TBL2] summarizes the activation energies of propagation (at 0–20% weight loss). Finally, the activation energies of certain conversions (5, 10, 15, and 20% weight loss) are determined by MHRK technique.
 These activation energies increase with percentage weight loss ([TBL3]). The results are similar for all nanocomposites.
