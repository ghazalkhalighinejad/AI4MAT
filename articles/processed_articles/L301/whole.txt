Properties of poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate)-silica nanocomposites obtained by the sol–gel processPoly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) swollen in water forms a hydrogel with good biological acceptance but poor mechanical properties. Reinforcement by a nanometric silica phase obtained by acid catalyzed sol–gel reaction of tetraethoxysilane occurring simultaneously with the polymerization of the organic polymer leads to a hybrid material and is a way to improve the mechanical properties of the homopolymer. Dynamic mechanical measurements show a stiffness increase in the rubbery state as the silica content is increased, for both the xerogel (dry) and the swollen samples. Density measurements of the hybrid materials show that the silica phase has an apparent density close to that of vitreous silica, thus giving an indication of the intimate interpenetration of the organic and the inorganic phases in these nanocomposites. Thermogravimetric analysis has been used to probe the dependence of the thermal stability of the samples on the silica content, and to determine the actual silica amounts in each sample. Information about the percolation threshold of the silica phase could be gained from measurements of water uptake and mechanical moduli. All the results pointed out that the co-continuity of matrix and reinforcement starts at around 15wt% of silica content.['Poly(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate) is an acrylic polymer which forms a hydrogel with good biological properties, making it useful for medical applications.
 This polymer behaves as a rubber at room temperature, with a glass transition temperature (<i>T</i> g) of 15.2°C [bib1 bib2]. Its large capacity of water uptake leads to decreased mechanical resistance [bib3], and thus it is interesting to find ways to reinforce it while keeping its hydrogel properties.
 One way to do this is to produce hybrid organic–inorganic nanocomposites with an included silica phase obtained simultaneously with the polymer in a sol–gel process.
 The sol–gel reaction is a polymerization process in which a silica precursor hydrolyzes and condenses to form a network.
 The characteristics of the resulting network depend on some critical parameters of the reaction such as the relative rate of the hydrolysis and the condensation reactions [bib4 bib5], the molar ratio between water and alkoxide [bib6], the acidic or basic character of the environment [bib4], the nature [bib7] and quantity [bib8] of the solvent in which the sol–gel reaction takes place, and also on whether the hydrolysis takes place in a single or in multiple steps [bib9]. In this work the silica precursor used was tetraethoxysilane (also called tetraethyl orthosilicate, TEOS). By the simultaneous polymerization of the polymeric matrix and the silica phase a new kind of hybrid material is obtained, in which the silica phase is dispersed in the form of domains with typical sizes of tens of nanometers [bib10]. The complete process by which the final silica phase develops takes place in three steps: the hydrolysis of the alkoxide groups of TEOS to form silanols, the condensation of the previously formed silanols to polymerize into silica polymers, and the aggregation of partially condensed silica macromolecules to build up the network [bib4]. Under acid catalyzed reaction conditions and with a stoichiometrically deficient amount of water it is known that the condensation rate is much greater than the production of silanols by the hydrolysis reaction, and the silica forms as an extremely fine (nanometer sized) network [bib4]. It has been reported that the addition of a co-solvent like ethanol makes the hydrolysis reaction faster for TEOS [bib11]. Nonetheless, taking advantage of the good miscibility between TEOS and 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), no additional solvent was added in this study since silanols are rapidly formed in the presence of water after a short induction time, making the solution of TEOS miscible with the solution of HEA and initiator [bib11]. The final properties of the nanocomposites depend on the relative amounts and on the morphology of the two component phases in the hybrid material, and on the interaction between them.
 The relative rates of polymerization of the organic and inorganic phases induce phase separation, but when the silica network forms faster than the PHEA one, the size of the typical phase aggregate is so small that transparent hybrid materials are obtained [bib10]. This was the case of the present work, where the polymerizing conditions were chosen so that the PHEA-based sol–gel nanocomposites obtained were completely transparent, like the pure PHEA homopolymer.
', 'Transparency and high water uptake combined with improved mechanical properties make this kind of hybrid systems promising for potential biomedical applications such as contact lenses, meniscal or intervertebral disk prostheses.
'].
 This indicates that the characteristic size of the silica phase is small enough (less than a few hundred nanometers) not to disperse light [bib10 bib12]. [fig1]  shows both the refractive index for dry (<i>n</i> dry) and swollen (<i>n</i> sw) samples.
 By contrast, for the swollen samples there is a sharp fall of the refractive index at the smallest silica contents, which then remains almost constant for the rest of silica contents, except for 10wt% which is even higher than for pure PHEA.
', 'As seen in [fig2] , the density of the nanocomposites varies linearly with their silica content (expressed as mass fraction). The extrapolated value for pure silica obtained from that trend is 2.196kg/dm3, which coincides with the value for the pure silica glass obtained after a heat treatment at 900°C [bib4].', 'The water and acetone sorption capacity of the samples, referred to the mass of the organic polymer (PHEA) in the sample, is shown also on [fig2]. The equilibrium water uptake of the nanocomposites as a function of silica content is first increasing and then decreasing: for silica contents lower than 15% the nanocomposites absorb more water than does pure PHEA, their specific sorption capacity falling afterwards under that of the pure matrix polymer.
 On the contrary, acetone uptake shows a sharp initial decrease at the lowest silica content (5wt%), and then smoothly decreases at higher silica content.
', 'The FTIR spectra for three nanocomposites (10, 20 and 30wt%) and for pure PHEA are represented in [fig3] . With increasing silica contents of the nanocomposites there is an intensity increase of some characteristic peaks of the silica phase such as the Si–O–Si stretching at 1085, 1024 and 800cm−1 [bib13 bib14]. At the same time, the OH stretching at 3405cm−1, the CH<i></i>x  asymmetric and symmetric stretching peaks at 2962 and 2888cm−1, respectively, and the CO stretching peak at 1724cm−1 tend to disappear with increasing silica content.
 The peaks that could reveal heterogeneous condensation reactions between the HEA monomers and the silanols, such as the characteristic peak for the Si–O–C bond, should take place at 1120–1080 and 836cm−1 [bib13 bib14]; they overlap the absorption interval of the Si–O–Si bond and are thus not distinguishable in our spectra.
', '[fig4] (a) shows the curves for the temperature dependence of the dynamic-mechanical storage modulus (<i>E</i>′) of dry samples.
 Pure PHEA exhibits a well defined plateau above the glass transition due to transesterification reactions which are unavoidable during its polymerization, building a network with chemical bonds between lateral side groups even with the absence of crosslinking agents [bib15]. The rubbery plateau in the hybrid materials has a higher storage modulus the greater the silica content.
 The rubbery modulus of some nanocomposite samples (especially the 15%, 20% and 25% samples) showed a marked increasing trend for the highest temperatures.
', '[fig4](b) shows the loss tangent thermograms of pure PHEA and of the nanocomposites.
 The pure PHEA plot shows two maxima: one corresponding to the main, or <i>α</i>, mechanical relaxation at around 26°C, and another one at lower temperatures, associated to a complex side-chain relaxation with small amounts of water [bib3 bib16]. Both of them show up again in the nanocomposites.
 The relaxation related to the lateral groups (<i>β,</i>β sw) seems to decrease with increased silica content (see insert in [fig4](b)). The values of the elastic modulus of the swollen samples measured at 25°C are shown in [fig7] .', 'The weight losses of pure PHEA, of the nanocomposites and of pure silica due to thermal degradation are shown in [fig5] . There is a shift of the onset of weight loss to lower temperatures as the silica content increases, making hybrid materials less thermally stable than the homopolymer.
 [fig5] also reveals that pure PHEA exhibits three different degradation steps [bib17], which persist in the nanocomposite samples but shifted to lower temperatures, as remarked above.
 Additional degradation data are shown in [tbl1] .', 'The residue of pure silica at 700°C is a 95.47% of its starting weight ([fig5]). This small weight decay can be the product of two mechanisms [bib4]: at lower temperatures degradation of non hydrolyzed alkoxide groups takes place; and for higher temperatures, condensation reactions continue releasing water molecules, producing a further weight loss.
 The residues after pyrolysis of the nanocomposites showed that the silica rests kept the original shape of the sample, but shrunk (the higher the silica content, the lower the shrinkage). All of them exhibited a smooth surface with occasional cracks, as can be seen in [fig6] .', 'In order to provide a direct morphological evidence of the dispersion of silica within these hybrid systems an elemental microanalysis study was performed.
 [fig8]  shows the cryo-fractures and X-ray microanalysis of hybrid materials with 10, 20 and 30wt% of silica content.
