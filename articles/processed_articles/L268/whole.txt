Ultrahigh-shear processing for the preparation of polymer/carbon nanotube compositesPoly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) composites were prepared using a novel ultrahigh-shear extruder by directly mixing MWCNT with PVDF in the molten state. A special feedback-type screw was used to obtain a high shear field and obtain a very uniform dispersion of the nanotubes in the polymer matrix under a higher screw rotation speed. Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to determine the interaction and dispersion of nanotubes in the PVDF. The linear viscoelastic behavior and electrical conductivity of these composites were investigated. At low-frequencies, the storage shear modulus (<i>G</i>′) becomes almost independent of the frequency as nanotube loading increases, suggesting the onset of solid-like behavior in these composites. By plotting <i>G</i>′ vs. nanotube loading and fitting with a power-law function, we found that the rheological threshold of high-shear processed composites is about 0.96wt% whereas that of low-shear processed composites is about 1.76wt%. The electrical percolation threshold of high-shear processed composites is lower than that of low-shear processed composites.['The nanoscale dimensions, along with their large shape anisotropy, high mechanical strength, and very high thermal and electrical conductivities, make carbon nanotubes (CNTs) an excellent material for nanocomposites, in which even a very small number of CNTs can induce significant changes in the material properties [bib1]. However, for intractable polymers, this potential has not been realized, mainly because of difficulties related to solubility.
 Although polymer CNT nanocomposites can be prepared by merely mixing CNTs with the melt polymer [bib2], an appropriate chemical treatment of the nanotube surfaces is needed for realizing a uniform dispersion [bib3]. To improve the dispersion of CNTs in polymers, one approach is the chemical modification of the CNT surface, where the active sites are introduced onto the surface of CNTs by chemical oxidation and these nanotubes can be given additional functions as required.
 The dispersion of CNTs in solvents or polymers in the presence of surfactants is another method that does not require chemical reactions [bib3].', 'In the past decade, several methods have been applied for the synthesis of CNT/polymer nanocomposites: physical mixing of the CNTs with polymers [bib4], electrospinning [bib5], in situ polymerization in the presence of CNTs [bib6], surfactant-assisted processing of CNT/polymer nanocomposites [bib7], mechanochemical pulverization processes [bib8], the innovative latex fabrication method [bib9], coagulation spinning [bib10], and solid-state shear pulverization [bib11]. Since the first polymer nanocomposites using CNTs as a filler were reported in 1994 by Ajayan [bib12], improving the dispersion is still a big challenge facing scientists.
', 'Different from the chemical modification of the CNT surface, we devised a new strategy to directly disperse CNTs in polymer melt by using the ultrahigh-shear extruder developed by us.
 The extruder can reach a maximum screw (<i>L</i>/<i>D</i> =1.78) rotation speed of 3000rpm, which corresponds to an average shear rate of 4410s−1. A specially designed feedback-type screw was used to make the sample circulate in the extruder chamber during melt mixing.
 By using this new machine, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and polyamide 11 (PA11) were directly melt-blended and the so-called nanoblend was obtained [bib13 bib14], in which the diameters of dispersed PA11 domains in PVDF phase are several tens of nanometers.
 Very recently, we have also succeeded in preparing the nano-dispersed elastomer/CNTs composites using the extruder [bib15].', 'Levi et al. have reported the preparation of PVDF/CNTs composites using the solvent casting method and have shown that the nanotubes are observed to form a well-dispersed, structurally random nanophase within the fluoropolymer matrix.
 The solution-cast composite thin films exhibit enhancements in both the pyroelectric response and mechanical transduction over pure polymer [bib16].', 'In this study, we report the fine dispersion of CNTs in the PVDF via a simple mechanical method by using the novel ultrahigh-shear extruder for the first time.
'].
 The resulting SEM images are shown in [fig2] . The dispersed bright dots and lines correspond to the broken MWCNTs.
 As shown in [fig2], the dispersion of MWCNTs in the PVDF matrix under different shearing conditions was revealed.
 It is unambiguous from [fig2]a,b that the MWCNTs are homogeneously dispersed in the PVDF matrix without any aggregation under high shearing.
 The diameter of the nanotubes shown in [fig2]b is about 40nm, which corresponds to the pristine diameter of individual nanotubes, 30–50nm.
 Aggregates are clearly observed in the MWCNT/PVDF composites under low shearing as shown in [fig2]c, d.
 In addition, as shown in [fig2]b, the nanotubes appear interconnected at ∼1wt% nanotube loading, which suggests a nanotube network.
 At the same MWCNT loading, composites with poor nanotube dispersion ([fig2]d) have discrete nanotube-rich domains rather than a nanotube network, such that the polymer chains flow independent of the nanotubes, and their motion is similar to that of pure PVDF.
', '[fig3]  shows the relationship between the electrical conductivity and the weight fraction of MWCNTs in the composites.
 As shown in curve (a) of volume conductivity in [fig3], when the concentration of MWCNTs is lower than 1.2wt%, conductivity gradually increases with increasing nanotube content.
 The conductivity of the composite containing 1.9wt% MWCNTs increases to 2.5×10−2 S/cm from that of the composite containing 1.2wt% MWCNT, 4.9×10−14 S/cm.
 The conductivity does not show any pronounced increase with further increasing MWCNT content to 1.9wt% or higher, assuming that the network is formed by geometrically overlapped nanotubes in the case of 1.5wt% MWCNTs in PVDF/MWCNT high-shear processed composites.
 The same trend was observed for surface conductivity of composites under high-shear processing, and the jump of surface conductivity under high-shear processing is observed when the MWCNT loading is about 1.5wt%.', 'As an explanation of this stepwise change in conductivity, it is generally accepted that the nanotube loading reached the conductivity threshold and a conductive network formed through hopping and tunneling processes [bib17]. As the concentration of MWCNTs increases and assuming efficient mixing, the average distance between nanotubes decreases until a three-dimensional (3D) interconnection of nanotubes in the PVDF matrix is formed.
 Electron transport is then facilitated through tunneling throughout the polymer or by electron ‘hopping’ along CNT interconnects [bib18].', 'The screw rotation speed of the extruder has an apparent effect on the electrical conductivity of the materials as shown in curve (b) of [fig3]. A significant increase in conductivity is achieved for a percolation threshold of about 2.5wt% under low-shear processing, while the percolation threshold is 1.5wt% for high-shear processing.
 The <i>G</i>′ of the PVDF/MWCNT composites with different nanotube loadings are presented in [fig4] .', 'At low-frequencies, PVDF chains are fully relaxed and exhibit typical homopolymer-like terminal behavior with scaling properties approximated by <i>G</i>′∼ <i>ω</i> 2. However, this terminal behavior disappears, and the dependence of <i>G</i>′ on <i>ω</i> at low-frequency is weak when the nanotube loading is higher than ∼1wt% for high-shear processed composites and ∼2wt% for low-shear processed one.
 The low-frequency power-law dependence of <i>G</i>′ weakens monotonically with increasing nanotube loading, from <i>ω</i> 1.77 for pure PVDF to <i>ω</i> 0.09 for PVDF90 and <i>ω</i> 0.19 for PVDF9, as listed in [tbl1].', 'This <i>G</i>′ is almost independent of <i>ω</i> at low-frequencies when the nanotube loading is higher than the threshold, which is indicative of a transition from liquid-like to solid-like viscoelastic behavior.
 This non-terminal low-frequency behavior can be attributed to a nanotube network, which restrains the long-range motion of polymer chains [bib19]. The 3<i>D</i> nanotube network appears to exist, in which nanotubes randomly intersect each other.
 These observations are similar to the liquid-to-solid or liquid-to-gel transitions observed by Winter and Mours [bib20] in their gel studies.
 Similar rheological behaviors have been observed in polymer composites containing clays [bib21 bib22] or carbon nanotubes [bib23 bib24 bib25 bib26 bib27].', 'At high frequencies, the effect of the nanotubes on the rheological behavior is relatively weak.
', '[fig5]  shows the relationship between <i>G</i>′ at 0.5rad/s and MWCNT loading in both high- and low-shear processed PVDF/MWCNTs composites.
 As shown in [fig5]a, <i>G</i>′ increases sharply between 0.8 and 1.2wt% loading, indicating that there is a sudden change in the material structure.
 A power-law relation can be used here to determine the threshold of the rheological percolation [bib28]   G  ′ ∝  (  m  -   m  c  )  β ,where <i>G</i>′ is the storage modulus, <i>m</i> is the MWCNT mass fraction, <i>m</i> c is the threshold of the rheological percolation, and <i>β</i> is the critical exponent.
 When the shear frequency is fixed, a power-law dependence of <i>G</i>′ on the nanotube loading exists in these MWCNT composites ([fig5]a inset). The rheological percolation threshold at 0.5rad/s is 0.96wt%.', 'Du et al. [bib28] discussed the impact of nanotube dispersion on the viscoelastic properties of polymer/nanotube composites.
 [fig5]b shows that the rheological percolation threshold of low-shear processed composites is 1.76wt% at 0.5rad/s.
', '[fig6]  shows the Raman spectra of the tangential mode of the pristine MWCNTs and the MWCNTs in the composite.
 The frequency of the mode of the MWCNTs in the composite is shifted up by 10cm−1 relative to that of the pristine MWCNTs.
 It has been shown that when CNTs are functionalized with bromine, an electron acceptor, the tangential mode shifts up by 24cm−1 [bib29]. Similarly, the tangential mode in fluorinated HiPco produced SWCNTs was shifted up by 11cm−1 relative to that in non-fluorinated SWCNTs.
 The shift of the tangential mode frequency observed here for the MWCNTs in PVDF suggests some interaction between the polymer and the MWCNTs possibly via the fluorine of PVDF [bib30].', 'Similar changes in the tangential mode frequencies and the radial breathing mode (RBM) frequencies are observed when carbon nanotubes are functionalized with acceptor groups.
', '[fig7]  shows the Raman spectra in the C–H stretch region of the polymer without MWCNTs and with MWCNTs.
 Two peaks are observed in polymer having frequencies at 2986 and 3026cm−1. These peaks are shifted to 2982cm−1 and 3022cm−1 in composites, respectively.
