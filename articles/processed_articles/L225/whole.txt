Effects of silane functionalization on the properties of carbon nanotube/epoxy nanocompositesThe effects of silane functionalization of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on properties of CNT/epoxy nanocomposites are investigated in this work. Epoxy-based nanocomposites reinforced with CNTs with and without functionalization were prepared. The properties of nanocomposites were characterized extensively using the scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), electrical conductivity measurement, thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), three-point bending test and fracture toughness measurement. The results showed that grafting silane molecules onto the CNT surface improved the dispersion of CNTs in epoxy along with much enhanced mechanical and thermal properties as well as fracture resistance of nanocomposites compared to those containing CNTs without functionalization. The electrical conductivity of nanocomposites decreased due to the wrapping of CNTs with non-conductive silane molecules. These findings confirmed the improved interfacial interactions arising from covalent bonds between the functionalized CNTs and epoxy resin.['With unique structural and transport properties, such as excellent strength, modulus, electrical and thermal conductivities along with a low density, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much interest as the reinforcement for polymer–matrix composites [bib1 bib2 bib3]. The CNT/polymer nanocomposites hold the promise of delivering exceptional mechanical properties and multi-functional characteristics.
 The potential of employing CNTs as reinforcements has, however, been severely limited because of the difficulties associated with dispersion of entangled CNTs during processing and the poor interfacial interactions between CNTs and polymer.
 To ensure effective reinforcements for polymer composites, proper dispersion and good interfacial bonds between CNTs and polymer–matrix have to be guaranteed [bib4].', 'Epoxy resin-based CNT nanocomposites have been extensively investigated in view of their potential applications in the electronics, aerospace and automotive industries [bib5 bib6 bib7]. However, there is no consensus regarding the efficiency of CNTs in improving the certain properties of nanocomposites: for example, the mechanical properties of epoxy resin were enhanced with less than 1wt% of CNT [bib8 bib9], whereas negligible improvement or even adverse effects were reported on the mechanical properties owing to CNTs [bib10 bib11]. These discrepancies are thought to be attributed to the fact that there were large differences in the degree of entanglement and dispersion of CNTs in the resin, as well as in interfacial adhesion between the CNT and the matrix because the CNTs were not properly functionalized in many of the above studies.
', 'This paper is part of a large project on the development of CNT functionalization techniques for improved dispersion and interfacial interactions with polymer resins, and is continuation of our previous work on the use of a silane coupling agent [bib12]. In the present work, the improved dispersion and interfacial adhesion due to silane are realized by evaluating various mechanical, fracture, thermal and electrical properties of the CNT/epoxy nanocomposites.

[['Dispersion of CNT in epoxy', ['[fig2] shows the SEM images of the fracture surface of nanocomposites, providing some insight into the CNT dispersion state.
 Silane molecules with epoxy end-groups were covalently attached on the CNT surface via the silanization reaction and partial hydrolysis of silane after functionalization ([fig3]) [bib12], resulting in the conversion of CNT surface from hydrophobic to hydrophilic nature, and thus allowing the dispersion of silane-CNTs in epoxy more uniform than the untreated-CNTs.
 Decomposition temperatures of nanocomposites measured at differing weight losses are presented in [tbl1]. Decomposition temperatures, <i>T</i>5, <i>T</i>10 and <i>T</i>dm, varied differently depending on the CNT surface functionalization: for the samples containing less than 0.25wt% of silane-CNT, <i>T</i>5, <i>T</i>10 and <i>T</i>dm increased with increasing CNT content, indicating that the thermal decomposition of silane-CNT/epoxy nanocomposites was retarded by the presence of silane-CNT.
 While the residual yields of both the CNT/epoxy nanocomposites increased with increasing CNT content, the silane-CNT exhibited much higher residual yields than the untreated-CNT for CNT contents below 0.5wt%. These results may be attributed to the physical barrier effect [bib14] where the CNTs impede the propagation of decomposition reactions in the nanocomposites.
 The significantly improved thermal stability of the nanocomposites with a small quantity of silane-CNT (0.25wt%) has practical implications in many potential applications at elevated temperatures.
']], ['Thermomechanical properties of nanocomposites', ['[fig4] shows the storage modulus and tan<i>δ</i> of nanocomposites obtained from the DMA analysis.
 In contrast, there was a stronger effect of silane-CNT in the rubbery region at elevated temperatures where the improvement in the elastic properties of nanocomposites was clearly observed ([fig4]a). This behavior can be explained in terms of interfacial interactions between the CNTs and epoxy.
 There were marginal reductions in storage modulus of the nanocomposites containing untreated-CNT compared to the neat epoxy in the glassy region ([fig4]c), as a result of CNT agglomeration.
', 'The tan<i>δ</i> values of the nanocomposites were calculated by dividing the loss modulus by the corresponding storage modulus obtained from the DMA analysis, as shown in [fig4]b and d.
 Broad glass transition peaks and shoulders were noted from the tan<i>δ</i> curves of the nanocomposites containing silane-CNT (curve B, C, E in [fig4]b). These phenomena can be attributed to the fact that: (i) the silane-treated CNT promoted the cross-linking reactions of epoxy and hardener, effectively discouraging the movement of molecular chains; and (ii) the covalent bonding between the silane-treated CNT and epoxy promoted energy dissipation from the matrix to the CNT, resulting in an increase in loss modulus.
', 'From [fig4]b and d, glass transition temperatures, <i>T</i>g, were determined, which are shown as a function of CNT content in [fig5]. The presence of CNT in the epoxy matrix increased the <i>T</i>g of nanocomposites, with the effect being more pronounced for the silane-CNT.
 Once the silane-CNT content exceeded a certain limit, say about 0.5wt%, however <i>T</i>g started to decrease because the epoxy/diamine ratio exceeded the value required by the reaction stoichiometry, which in turn decreased the degree of cross-linking in the nanocomposites [bib5 bib8].']], ['Mechanical properties of nanocomposites', ['[fig6] shows the elastic moduli and strengths measured from the flexural test of nanocomposites, which are plotted as a function of CNT content.
 It is found that the modulus rapidly increased with increasing CNT content, before being saturated at about 0.25wt% of CNT content.
 The flexural strength of nanocomposites presented a similar trend: the strengths of the silane-CNT samples were consistently higher than the untreated-CNT counterparts when the reinforcement contents were 0.25wt% or below.
 An anomaly was observed for the composite containing 0.5wt% CNT with a reduction of flexural strength.
']], ['Fracture resistance of nanocomposites', ['The quasi-static fracture toughness, <i>K</i>IC, values of nanocomposites measured from the compact tension test is plotted as a function of CNT content in [fig7]. It is interesting to note that the general trends of <i>K</i>IC with respect to CNT content were largely different depending on whether the CNT was functionalized or not.
 These phenomena can be explained in terms of dispersion and interfacial interactions between the CNT and epoxy: for the untreated-CNT, both the dispersion in epoxy and the interfacial interaction were poor due to the agglomeration ([fig2]a) and the inherently inert/hydrophobic nature of CNTs.
 After silane functionalization, both the dispersion of CNTs ([fig2]b) and the interfacial interaction with epoxy was enhanced through the attachment of oxygen containing functional groups and silane molecules onto the CNT surface, as shown in our previous study [bib12].', 'Major fracture mechanisms were identified based on the morphological analysis of the fracture surfaces of nanocomposites taken near the initial crack tip, as shown in [fig8 fig9]. The neat epoxy ([fig8]a) exhibited a smooth, mirror-like fracture surface representing brittle failure of a homogeneous material. No obvious difference was observed between the neat epoxy and the composite containing 0.05wt% untreated-CNT ([fig8]b). With further increase in CNT content ([fig8]c–e) , the CNTs tended to agglomerate into larger sizes, while the overall fracture surface morphology did not alter much with only marginal increases in the number of river markings.
 At low CNT contents (0.05–0.1wt%), there were straight and long river markings running parallel to the crack propagation direction ([fig9]a and b). At higher CNT contents (0.25–0.5wt%, [fig9]c and d), these river markings became shorter and round-ended, similar to those observed in nanocomposites reinforced with high contents of nanoclay particles [bib15]. It appears that the increasing number of river markings roughly corresponds to the number of isolated, well-dispersed CNTs, which forced the cracks to propagate bypassing the CNTs and taking a long path.
 However, the fracture toughness became more or less saturated at about 0.5wt% CNT content, indicating that a higher CNT content would not result in further increase in fracture resistance because there is an increasing chance of agglomeration with increasing CNT content.
 The electrical conductivity is plotted as a function of CNT content in [fig10]. The incorporation of the untreated-CNT increased the conductivity almost nine orders of magnitude, from 2.2×10−13 to 5.9×10−4S/cm when the filler content was increased from 0.05 to 0.50wt%. This observation was consistent with previous findings on CNT nanocomposites based on similar matrix materials [bib16 bib17 bib18]. However, for the same filler content increase, the nanocomposites containing silane-CNT exhibited only a marginal – about two orders of magnitude – improvement in conductivity.
 The wrapped polymer perturbs the π electron system of the CNT walls [bib19]. Secondly, the improved dispersion of CNTs in polymer–matrix is known to be detrimental to the formation of electrical networks, especially at CNT contents above the percolation threshold.
 Further details of the correlation between the electrical conductivity and the dispersion states of CNT nanocomposites are presented elsewhere [bib20].']]].
