Electrical conductivity and dielectric response of poly(vinylidene fluoride)–graphite nanoplatelet compositesPoly(vinylidene fluoride)/graphite nanoplatelets (PVDF/GNP) composites were fabricated using solution mixing followed by compression molding. The electric conducting and dielectric behavior of such nanocomposites were determined over a wide frequency range from 102 to 107. The results showed that the electrical behavior of PVDF/GNP nanocomposites can be well described by the percolation theory. Both conductivity and dielectric constant were found to be greatly enhanced at the percolation threshold. A large dielectric constant of 173 and low loss tangent of 0.65 were observed in the PVDF/2.5wt% GNP nanocomposite at 1kHz. Moreover, dynamic mechanical analysis was also used to characterize the relaxations of polymers in PVDF/GNP nanocomposites. Dielectric and mechanical relaxations of PVDF/GNP nanocomposites showed strong dependence with frequency and temperature. The activation energy for glass transition determined from mechanical relaxation is considerably higher than that evaluated from the dielectric analysis. This resulted from different operating mechanisms for dielectric and mechanical relaxation processes.['The rapid development of electronic devices has led to a large demand for polymer materials with good electrical conductivity and thermal stability as well as high mechanical strength.
 Conventional polymeric materials usually exhibit low modulus and poor electrical conductivity.
 Thus, conducting microfillers of large volume fractions are added to polymers to improve their electrical conductivity [bib0005]. High filler loading generally leads to low mechanical strength and ductility as well as poor processability of polymer composites.
 In this regard, nanometric sized fillers are incorporated into polymers to enhance their mechanical and physical properties.
 Polymer nanocomposites filled with conducting components have attracted considerable worldwide attention due to their potential applications as materials for anti-static coatings, electromagnetic interference shielding, embedded capacitors, gas sensors and bipolar plates for polymer electrolyte fuel cells [bib0010 bib0015 bib0020 bib0025 bib0030 bib0035]. The most common used nanofillers include graphite nanoplatelets and carbon nanotubes.
 The high cost and large tendency for forming agglomerates are the main deficiencies of using carbon nanotubes as conducting fillers.
', "Graphite is a naturally carbonaceous material with high conductivity, low cost and abundance.
 In-plane Young's modulus and electrical conductivity of graphite are close to those of carbon nanotubes [bib0040]. Natural graphite of layered structure can be converted to graphite oxide or graphite intercalation compound (GIC) through chemical oxidation in strong oxidizers such as concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid solution.
 Unlike graphite, graphite oxide is hydrophilic due to the attachment of function hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on their surfaces [bib0045]. Expanded graphite (EG) is then obtained by rapid expansion of GIC in a furnace, and can be further exfoliated into thin graphite nanoplatelet (GNPs) of large aspect ratios via sonication [bib0050], resulting in composites with very low percolation thresholds [bib0055 bib0060 bib0065 bib0070 bib0075 bib0080]. The sharp increase in the conductivity is basically attributed to the formation of conducting network within the polymer matrix.
 Based on the remarkable physical properties of graphene sheets, economically viable polymer nanocomposites with excellent electrical and mechanical properties can be produced.
", 'In recent years, the size of integrated circuits continues to decrease, leading to performance requirement for polymeric materials with higher dielectric permittivity increases significantly.
 In this regard, conducting polymer nanocomposites with large dielectric permittivity and low dielectric loss have become the focus of many studies due to their distinct advantages over conventional brittle ceramics [bib0085 bib0090 bib0095 bib0100 bib0105 bib0110 bib0115]. Lie at al. studied the electrical conductivity and dielectric properties of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) composites filled with pristine, carboxyl and ester functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) [bib0110]. A large dielectric constant of 3600 can be obtained in the carboxyl functionalized MWCNT/PVDF composite filled with 8vol% MWCNT at 1kHz.
 For graphene-filled composites, high values of dielectric constant can be obtained at low frequency for highly conducting PS/GNP and SAN/GNP nanocomposites [bib0120 bib0125].', 'Polyvinylidene fluoride is a semi-crystalline polymer exhibiting excellent thermal stability, unique piezoelectric and pyroelectric characteristics.
 PVDF finds wide industrial and biomedical engineering applications because of these excellent properties.
 PVDF/GNP nanocomposites comprise a new generation of multifunctional materials that combine the properties of PVDF and GNP.
 PVDF filled with graphite microparticles generally required large filler content (e.
g.
 10wt%) to reach desired electrical properties [bib0130]. Therefore, GNPs with large aspect ratios are more effective than graphite microparticles to enhance electrical properties of PVDF.
 Indeed, this study demonstrates that the electrical conductivity and dielectric constant of PVDF/GNP nanocomposites increase markedly by adding low GNP content.
 Furthermore, the additions of GNPs of large surface areas can affect the molecular mobility and relaxation of PVDF molecular chains to a large extent.
 The unique of this study is the use of dielectric relaxation for the determination of the activation energy of glass transition for PVDF/GNP nanocomposites.
 Our results showed that GNPs affect the glass transition temperature and activation energy of PVDF.
 These arise from the restrained mobility of PVDF molecular chains due to GNPs and strong interactions between functional groups of GNPs and the PVDF matrix.
 The results are novel and have not been reported in the literature for PVDF filled with graphite nanoplatelets.
'].
[['Structure and morphology', ['[fig0005](a)–(d) shows the SEM images of the resulting PVDF/GNP nanocomposites.
 Graphite nanoplatelets with a diameter of several micrometers and thickness of few nanometers can be readily seen in higher magnification image of PVDF/2wt% GNP nanocomposite ([fig0005](d)). Further, solution mixing enables homogenous dispersion of GNPs in the PVDF matrix due to interaction of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups of GNPs with PVDF matrix.
 Polar β-form PVDF is of particular interest due to its piezoelectric effect, and generally can be prepared by mechanical stretching the α-form PVDF film or by evaporating the PVDF solvent at relatively low temperature (normally <70°C) [bib0140]. [fig0010] shows the XRD patterns of PVDF/GNP nanocomposites.
 Two peaks located at 18.5o and 19.9o can be assigned to the characteristic peaks of α-PVDF.
 This is due to the matching of the crystal lattice of the organoclay with that of the β polymorph [bib0145]. From [fig0010], the peak intensity at 26.6o associated with graphite increases with increasing GNP content.
']], ['Electrical properties', ['[fig0015](a) shows the frequency dependence of electrical conductivity of PVDF/GNP nanocomposites.
 For low GNP loadings of 1–2wt%, the ac conductivity (<i>σ</i>′(<i>f</i>)) of PVDF/GNP nanocomposites increases with increasing frequency with a slope close to unity.
 For GNP loading ≥2.5wt%, a plateau regime is observed in the low frequency region.
 Above a critical frequency (<i>f</i>   <i>c</i>) in which <i>σ</i>=110% <i>σ</i>DC, the conductivity becomes frequency dependent again.
 The total AC conductivity in the tested frequency region can be expressed by the following equation: (1)  σ   ′(f)=   σ DC   +A   f   u  where <i>f</i> is the frequency, <i>σ</i>DC is frequency independent conductivity or DC conductivity at <i>f</i>→0Hz and <i>u</i> is an exponent.
 [eq0005] is often called “AC universal law” because various materials obey well with this expression [bib0150 bib0155]. At or below the percolation threshold (<i>Φ</i>   <i>c</i>), <i>σ</i>DC is extremely small and can be neglected.
 Then, the frequency dependence of <i>σ</i>′(<i>f</i>) can be written as: (2)  σ   ′(f,   ϕ   c)∝   f   u', 'Similar to <i>σ</i>′(<i>f</i>), a significant enhancement in dielectric constant is also observed near the percolation threshold.
 The dielectric response of materials to an alternating electric field is characterized by a complex permittivity (<i>ɛ</i>*) defined by: (3)  ε   *(f)=   ε   ′(f)−j   ε   ″(f)  where <i>ɛ</i>′(<i>f</i>) and <i>ɛ</i>″(<i>f</i>) are the real and imaginary parts of complex permittivity.
 Therefore, the loss tangent (tan<i>δ</i>) is defined as the ratio of <i>ɛ</i>″(<i>f</i>) to <i>ɛ</i>′(<i>f</i>).', '[fig0015](b) and (c) shows the variations of <i>ɛ</i>′(<i>f</i>) with frequency, and tan<i>δ</i> with frequency for PVDF and its nanocomposites.
 The dielectric constant is found to increase with increasing GNP content and can reach up to ∼3000 (1kHz) by adding 4wt% GNP.
 This can be attributed to the interfacial polarization in heterogeneous PVDF system filled with graphite nanosheets and to the formation of many mini-capacitors in polymer matrix [bib0085]. The former phenomenon is known as the Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars (MWS) mechanism which is caused by the large difference in dielectric constant between the polymer matrix and the filler.
 From [fig0015](c), the loss tangent is relatively low (i.
 <0.1) for the PVDF composites with GNP contents ≤2wt%. Above this content, the dielectric loss increases markedly with increasing filler content as a result of the formation of conducting network in the PVDF matrix.
', 'The variation of <i>ɛ</i>′(<i>f</i>) with frequency also follows the power law when the GNP content approaches the percolation threshold [bib0160]: (4)  ε   ′(f,   ϕ   c)∝   f −  v wherev is an exponent.
 [eq0005 eq0010 eq0020] are summarized in [tbl0005]. The <i>u</i> values for PVDF nanocomposites with GNP content below 2wt% are obtained using Eq.
 [eq0010], while those for specimens with GNP above 2.5wt% are evaluated from Eq.
 [eq0005]. From [tbl0005], the <i>u</i> values are found to decrease with increasing GN content.
 Near the percolation threshold, <i>u</i> is 0.8 for the PVDF/2.5wt% GNP nanocomposite, and close to the universal value of 0.7 [bib0160]. The  u  +  vvalue for the PVDF/2.5wt% GNP nanocomposite is 1.023 and agrees reasonably with the theoretical value of unity  (  u  +  v  =  1  )predicted by the percolation theory [bib0160].', '[fig0020 fig0025] show the respective plots of <i>σ</i>′(<i>f</i>) vs filler content and <i>ɛ</i>′(<i>f</i>) vs filler content for PVDF nanocomposites.
 The <i>σ</i>′(<i>f</i>) and <i>ɛ</i>′(<i>f</i>) values are taken from [fig0015](a) and (b) at 1kHz.
 According to the percolation theory, both the conductivity and dielectric constant exhibit a transition behavior in the vicinity of percolation threshold and can be expressed as [bib0160 bib0165 bib0170]: (5)  σ   ′(f)∝ (  ϕ  −   ϕ c)  t\u2009\u200a\u200aat\u2003ϕ>   ϕ   c   (6)  ε   ′(f)∝ϕ c−  ϕ ϕ c−  s where <i>Φ</i> is filler concentration, <i>Φ</i>   <i>c</i> represents the percolation threshold, <i>t</i> and <i>s</i> correspond to critical exponents.
 [eq0025] yields a percolation threshold of 2.4wt% and a critical exponent <i>t</i> of 3.07 (inset of [fig0020]). Furthermore, the conductivity increases by more than seven orders of magnitude when GNP reaches 4wt%. The critical exponent is larger than the theoretical value (<i>t</i>=2) for three disordered system.
 For example, Panwar and Mehra obtained <i>t</i>=2 for the SAN/GNP composites [bib0125]. Weng et al. reported a value of 2.32 for the nylon 6/foliated graphite nanocomposites [bib0055]. It is noted that a very small percolation threshold can be obtained in polymers filled with one-dimensional carbon nanotubes of aspect ratios over 1000 [bib0175]. Recently, Zhao et al. demonstrated that the PVDF/MWCNT nanocomposites exhibit a low percolation threshold of 0.07wt% [bib0180]. This is due to the ease of the formation of conducting path network.
', 'From [fig0025], the dielectric constant reaches an apparent maximum at the percolation concentration.
 A large dielectric constant of 173 and low loss tangent of 0.65 (at 1kHz) are found for the PVDF/2.5wt% GNP composite.
 [eq0030] produces an exponent of <i>s</i>=0.93 and <i>Φ</i>   <i>c</i>=2.4wt% for the PVDF/GNP nanocomposites ([fig0030]).', 'According to the percolation theory above, the parameters (<i>u</i>,v, <i>t</i>, <i>s</i>) exhibit the following relationship at the percolation threshold [bib0160]: (7)   u=   t t  +  s  (8)   v=   s t  +  s', 'From fitted <i>t</i> and <i>s</i> values for the PVDF/GNP system, we obtain <i>u</i>=0.77,  v  =  0.23and  u  +  v  =  1   . These results imply that the percolation theory can well describe the electrical conducting behavior and permittivity of the PVDF/GNP system.
 This transition temperature is a good indicator to reveal the interactions between the polymer and fillers [bib0185]. As mentioned above, graphite raw material has been subjected to acidic treatment prior to sonication to form GNPs.
 Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS) have been employed by researchers to investigate molecular dynamics in polymer blends and polymer/silica nanocomposites [bib0185 bib0190]. Accordingly, we used both techniques to investigate the segmental dynamics and glass transition in PVDF/GNP nanocomposites.
', '[fig0035 fig0040] illustrate the respective plots of DMA storage modulus and tanδ vs temperature for PVDF and representative PVDF/GNP nanocomposites.
 The loss tangent vs temperature curves ([fig0040](a)–(c)) exhibit a distinct relaxation peak with an apparent maximum.
', 'We can relate the temperature at the loss peak maximum with applied frequency by means of the Arrhenius-type equation [bib0190]: (9)   f=   f   0exp  −   E   a  RTwhere <i>f</i> is the excitation frequency, <i>f</i>   <i>0</i> a constant, <i>T</i> the maximum peak temperature, <i>R</i> the gas constant and <i>E</i>a the activation energy for dynamic mechanical relaxation process.
', 'A plot of log<i>f</i> vs 1/<i>T</i> should yield a straight line and the slope directly relates to the activation energy of the relaxation process.
 [eq0045] for PVDF and representative composites (below and above <i>Φ</i>   <i>c</i>) are displayed in [fig0045](a)–(c). The slopes of straight lines are found to increase due to the GNP additions, indicating strong interactions between GNPs and PVDF matrix.
 The activation energy (<i>E</i>a) and <i>T</i>g values determined by the DMA technique are tabulated in [tbl0010]. It can be seen that <i>T</i>g increases slowly with increasing GNP content while <i>E</i>a exhibits a maximum value near the percolation transition.
', 'From the dielectric analysis (DEA), the variations of dielectric constant and loss tangent with temperature for PVDF-GN nanocomposites filled with different GNP contents are displayed in [fig0050 fig0055]. Neat PVDF exhibits two relaxations near the glass transition temperature (−40 to 30°C) and high temperature regime (100–150°C). These correspond to the β- and α-relaxation processes of PVDF, respectively [bib0195]. Moreover, the dielectric constant of PVDF increases with increasing temperature.
 By adding GNP to the PVDF matrix, the relaxation process becomes significant due to the large permittivity of composites as shown in [fig0050](b) (below <i>Φ</i>   <i>c</i>) and [fig0050](c) (above <i>Φ</i>   <i>c</i>). For neat PVDF, the loss peak position is shifted towards higher temperatures with increasing frequency ([fig0055](a)). This behavior is particular apparent for the nanocomposite with filler content below the percolation limit, i.
 2wt% ([fig0055](b)). However, this relaxation peak diminishes in the PVDF/2.5wt% GNP nanocomposite due to a dramatic increase in dielectric loss associated with the formation of conducting network ([fig0055](c)).', 'The non-isothermal relaxations of dielectric properties also can be described by the Arrhenius-type equation.
 Accordingly, the maximum peak temperature displays a power relation with frequency: (10)   f=   f   0exp −  E   b  RTwhere <i>f</i> is the applied frequency, <i>T</i> the maximum peak temperature obtained from dielectric loss tangent, and <i>E</i>b the activation energy obtained from DEA.
', 'The Arrhenius plots of log<i>f</i> vs 1/<i>T</i> for PVDF/GN nanocomposites are shown in [fig0060](a)–(c). Comparing with the DMA results, the slopes of linear regression lines become smaller by adding GNPs.
 Thus GNP additions reduce the activation energy of PVDF in the DEA measurement ([tbl0010]). Therefore, the activation energy obtained from DEA is smaller than that of DMA.
 The mechanical relaxation determined from DMA is strongly associated with the segmental or molecular motions of PVDF matrix whereas dielectric relaxations are mainly related to the orientation polarization of CH2, CF2 groups.
 From the conductivity vs frequency plot, percolative PVDF/2.5wt% GNP nanocomposite exhibits an apparent DC plateau (low frequency regime) and frequency dependent region at high frequency.
 Hopping of electrons among the fillers predominates at high frequencies [bib0155]. At a low frequency of 1kHz, percolative PVDF/2.5wt% GNP nanocomposite exhibits a large dielectric constant of 173 and low loss tangent of 0.65. The dielectric constant of nanocomposite is nearly 18 times larger than that of neat PVDF having a value of ∼10. This is attributed to the formation of many minicapacitors in the polymer matrix in which dispersed GNP platelets are separated from each other by a thin layer of polymer matrix.
 The dielectric constant can reach up to ∼3000 (1kHz) beyond the percolation limit, i.
 4wt% GNP.
 The dielectric loss of the PVDF/4wt% GNP nanocomposite is ∼200. The dielectric loss is a measure of energy loss in the dielectric under an applied AC field.
 It is more likely that a large dielectric loss in the PVDF/4wt% GNP nanocomposite (with filler content above the threshold) results from the formation of conducting network paths, thereby allowing direct flow of charge carriers through them.
 At high frequency of 106Hz, the dielectric loss of the PVDF/4wt% GNP nanocomposite drops sharply to ∼1, possibly due to the dipoles have insufficient time to orient themselves along the direction of an AC field.
