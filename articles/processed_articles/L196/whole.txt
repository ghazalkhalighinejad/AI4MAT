Structure and thermal properties of poly(lactic acid)/cellulose whiskers nanocomposite materialsThe goal of this work was to produce nanocomposites based on poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and cellulose nanowhiskers (CNW). The CNW were treated with either <i>tert</i>-butanol or a surfactant in order to find a system that would show flow birefringence in chloroform. The nanocomposites were prepared by incorporating 5wt% of the different CNW into a PLA matrix using solution casting. Field emission scanning electron microscopy showed that untreated whiskers formed flakes, while <i>tert</i>-butanol treated whiskers formed loose networks during freeze drying. The surfactant treated whiskers showed flow birefringence in chloroform and transmission electron microscopy showed that these whiskers produced a well dispersed nanocomposite. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that both whiskers and composite materials were thermally stable in the region between 25°C and 220°C. The dynamic mechanical thermal analysis showed that both the untreated and the <i>tert</i>-butanol treated whiskers were able to improve the storage modulus of PLA at higher temperatures and a 20°C shift in the tan
                     <i>δ</i> peak was recorded for the <i>tert</i>-butanol treated whiskers.['Lately, there has been an increased interest in the use of biopolymers due to more environmentally aware consumers, increased price of crude oil and the concern about global warming.
 Biopolymers are naturally occurring polymers that are found in all living organisms.
 The use of biopolymers will have a less harmful effect on our environment compared to the use of fossil fuel based commodity plastics [bib1]. Biopolymers are based on renewable resources and will degrade to form carbon dioxide, water and biomass.
 The amount of carbon dioxide released during degradation is the same amount as the renewable resource harnessed during its cultivation.
 As a result carbon dioxide will not accumulate in the atmosphere due to the use of biopolymers.
 Biopolymers can today be retrieved from for example agricultural feedstock, marine fauna and microbial activities.
 Waste products from industries can also be utilized to produce biopolymers, for example waste from agriculture and marine food industries.
', 'Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a commercially available biopolymer.
 It is a biodegradable thermoplastic polyester produced from l- and d-lactic acid, which is derived from the fermentation of corn starch [bib2]. The properties of PLA are determined by the weight ratio of the two lactic acid molecules.
 PLA can therefore vary from being an amorphous polymer to being a semi or highly crystalline material [bib2]. PLA is one of the few biopolymers available today which have similar properties as fossil fuel based commodity plastics.
 PLA produced by NatureWorks has high mechanical strength and easy process ability compared to other biopolymers and is often compared to polystyrene or PET [bib2]. However, PLA softens at lower temperatures compared to equivalent petroleum based polymers [bib3]. A low softening temperature results in a lower temperature of use of the material, which in turn will limit the number of application of the material. Preparation of nanocomposites has been considered a promising method to increase the softening temperature of biopolymers [bib4 bib5].', 'In order to produce fully renewable and biodegradable nanocomposites both the polymer matrix and the nanoreinforcement have to be derived from renewable resources.
 Cellulose nanowhiskers (CNW) have attracted significant attention during the last decade as potential nanoreinforcement in different polymers [bib6]. Cellulose is abundant in nature, and is found in plants and can also be produced by bacteria.
 Cellulose nanowhiskers have good mechanical properties [bib6 bib7]. It is thought that these whiskers have mechanical strength that corresponds to the binding forces of neighboring atoms [bib6]. As a result cellulose whiskers have far better mechanical properties than a majority of the commonly used reinforcing materials.
 Biopolymer based nanocomposites have been produced by incorporating CNW into the following biopolymers matrices: cellulose acetate butyrate [bib8], poly(hydroxyalkanoates) [bib9], poly(lactic acid) [bib10], silk fibroin [bib11] and starch [bib12].', 'The use of cellulose nanowhiskers as nanoreinforcement is a new field in nanotechnology and as a result there are still many obstacles remaining to their use.
 Firstly, cellulose nanowhiskers are not commercially available.
 Secondly, their production is time consuming and is still associated with low yields.
 Thirdly, they are difficult to use in systems that are not water based due to their strong hydrogen bonding.
 This affects the production of PLA based nanocomposites when using PLA produced by NatureWorks which is not water soluble.
 The whiskers have to be transferred from water to an appropriate solvent for this type of PLA.
 It has been reported that transferring whiskers from water to other solvents is possible [bib8 bib13 bib14 bib15 bib16]. In order to determine if whiskers are well isolated in solutions flow birefringence is often used.
 There are a few different treatments that have been used to achieve birefringence in other solvents than water as for example the use of a surfactant [bib13], poly(ethylene glycol) grafting [bib14] and partial silylation [bib15]. Heux et al. used a surfactant on whiskers from both cotton and tunicin in order to achieve birefringence in toluene [bib13]. Flow birefringence in chloroform has been achieved by poly(ethylene glycol) grafting [bib14] and partial silylation [bib16] of cellulose whiskers.
 Unfortunately, both these modifications are complicated processes to carry out.
 There is also a negative side effect of using modified cellulose whiskers.
 It has been shown that modified whiskers have less reinforcing effect than unmodified whiskers.
 Grunert and Winter prepared nanocomposites with a hydrophobic thermoplastic matrix using trimethylsilylated cellulose whiskers [bib8]. They found that unmodified whiskers showed a better reinforcing performance than the trimethylsilylated whiskers.
 Similarly, the mechanical properties of nanocomposites containing chemically modified chitin whiskers from crab shell were found to be inferior to the unmodified nanocomposites [bib17].', 'The goal of this work was to produce poly(lactic acid) (PLA) based nanocomposites using cellulose nanowhiskers (CNW). The nanocomposites were prepared by solution casting using chloroform as solvent.
 The CNW used in this study were treated in two different ways in order to find one system that would show flow birefringence in chloroform.
 The whiskers were either transferred to <i>tert</i>-butanol or modified with a surfactant prior to freeze drying.
 Untreated cellulose whiskers were used as reference.
 The structure of the materials was studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Both thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) were carried out in order to investigate the thermal properties of the produced nanocomposites.

[['Processing and structure', ['The microcrystalline cellulose prior to acid hydrolysis is shown in [fig1]. These particles were ∼10–50μm and consisted of aggregated cellulose whiskers [bib18]. After hydrolysis the suspension showed flow birefringence as presented in [fig2]. This indicated the presence of isolated cellulose whiskers, which was confirmed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis, see [fig3]. The whiskers were ∼5nm in width and ∼200nm in length as found in other studies on cellulose whiskers from wood [bib19 bib20 bib21]. These unmodified whiskers will be referred to as cellulose nanowhiskers (CNW).', 'The goal of the processing was to obtain flow birefringence in chloroform.
 First, one set of cellulose whiskers were transferred from the reference solvent to <i>tert</i>-butanol, butanol cellulose nanowhiskers (B-CNW). <i>tert</i>-Butanol has a melting point of 23–25°C, which allows the suspension to freeze faster and thereby avoiding aggregation of the cellulose whiskers during the freezing process.
 The second strategy was to use a surfactant, surfactant cellulose nanowhiskers (S-CNW). The surfactant chosen had been used earlier by Heux et al. to create birefringence in toluene using whiskers from cotton and tunicin [bib13]. It was expected that the surfactant would hinder hydrogen bonding between the cellulose whiskers during freeze drying and further aid the distribution of the cellulose whiskers in chloroform.
 Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images of the freeze dried whiskers are presented in [fig4]. As can be seen the whiskers formed flakes during the freeze drying process.
 The S-CNW suspension showed flow birefringence in chloroform, as seen in [fig5]. It was evident that the S-CNW suspension contained a large number of single cellulose whiskers.
 A homogenizer has the ability to decrease the size of agglomerates and has been used to produce cellulose microfibrils [bib22]. This proved to be difficult due to the low boiling point of chloroform, 61°C.
 The whiskers were present in flakes as identified earlier, see [fig6]a.
 The PLA/CNW material can not be classified as a nanocomposite material. The cellulose whiskers appeared to be better distributed in the PLA/B-CNW nanocomposite as seen in [fig6]b.
 The PLA/S-CNW nanocomposite did however appear to be very porous as seen in [fig6]c.
', 'The materials containing surfactant were white, while the other materials were transparent, see [fig7]. This was probably due to the porous structure of the materials as seen in FESEM.
 The samples containing surfactant were pressed on a laboratory press (LPC 300, Fontijne Grotnes B.
, The Netherlands) at 162°C and 18MPa in order to see if these materials would turn transparent when the porosity was removed.
 [fig8] shows that both these materials did in fact turn transparent after they were melted and pressed.
 [fig9]a shows a cross-section of a whisker flake in the PLA matrix.
 In the PLA/B-CNW nanocomposite it was possible to detect looser agglomerates of whiskers than in the PLA/CNW material, as can be seen in [fig9]b.
 Small clusters of loosely aggregated whiskers were found throughout the samples studied of this material, see [fig9]c.
 The results from the TGA are presented in [fig10], which shows residual weight vs.
 [fig10] concludes that all materials were thermally stable in the region below 220°C.
 The recommended processing temperature of PLA is 200°C and both whiskers and composites were able to maintain more than 91% of their original weight at this temperature.
 In [fig10]a, one could detect a slight decrease in weight for all materials below 150°C which was due to the moisture content of these materials.
 The weight reduction of the S-CNW whiskers seemed to occur more stepwise than for the other materials and the S-CNW whiskers also had higher residual weight at 400°C.
 In [fig10]b, it was possible to distinguish a slightly improved thermal stability of the materials containing surfactant.
 On the whole, TGA showed that there was no degradation taking place in either whiskers or composites resulting in large weight reductions in the temperature region where PLA is either processed or used, 25–220°C.
 The storage modulus as a function of temperature and the tan<i>δ</i> peak for the produced materials are shown in [fig11]. These results showed that all whiskers were able to improve the storage modulus of pure PLA at higher temperatures.
 [fig11]a presents the DMTA results for PLA, PLA/CNW and PLA/B-CNW.
 At 60°C the B-CNW whiskers showed a larger improvement in storage modulus than the CNW whiskers, a 64% improvement vs.
 a 23% improvement.
 The TEM analysis ([fig9]b) also showed that PLA chains had been able to penetrate the B-CNW whiskers which would have a large affect on the segmental motion of the PLA chains.
 The tan<i>δ</i> peaks presented in [fig11]a supported this.
 The CNW whiskers showed a slight shift in the tan<i>δ</i> peak, 5°C, indicating only minor hindering of the segmental motions of the PLA matrix.
 The B-CNW whiskers on the other hand showed a much larger shift in tan<i>δ</i> peak, 20°C, which indicated significant change in the segmental motions of the PLA matrix.
 Similar behavior has been reported before when polymer chains have penetrated CNW bundles, but not to the same extent [bib23]. These results showed that the surface area of the incorporated CNW governed the improvement of the storage modulus of PLA in the plastic region.
', '[fig11]b presents the DMTA results for PLA and the two materials containing surfactant.
 As can be seen the materials containing 20wt% of surfactant showed reduced storage modulus in the elastic region compared to pure PLA.
 This can be explained by the large amount of surfactant added to these materials, decreased crystallinity and the porous structure seen in the FESEM study ([fig6]c). At higher temperatures where the PLA matrix softened a different behavior was seen, for example at 67°C the PLA/S material was able to improve the storage modulus of pure PLA with 38%. This together with the tan <i>δ</i> peaks shown in [fig11]b indicated a high level of interaction between the PLA matrix and the surfactant.
 The tan <i>δ</i> peak of PLA/S showed a 22°C shift and increased intensity compared to the peak for pure PLA.
 [fig11]b also presented the results for the PLA/S-CNW nanocomposite.
 The PLA/S-CNW material was able to increase the storage modulus of PLA/S in the elastic region, for example with 83% at 20°C.
 After the tan <i>δ</i> peak temperature when the PLA/S material softened the well dispersed whiskers were able to carry load and increase the storage modulus of the PLA/S material. Above 55°C the PLA/S-CNW nanocomposite was also able to improve the storage modulus of the pure PLA, even though the material contains 20wt% less PLA.
